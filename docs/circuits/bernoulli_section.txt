Input

Type

input (i)
distribution (di)

0 0.5 1

Output

Type

Example:
[bernoulli]
input
= G1
distribution = P1.1
output1
= G2
output2
= G4

Note: each time a positive trigger edge is seen at input
a new random decision is made for which output to use.
From now on that chosen output gets an exact copy of
the input signal â€“ even if it is not a simple trigger signal
but something more complex like an envelope. The other
output will send 0 V.

Default

Description

0

Send gate or trigger signals here.

0.5

This controls the probability of a gate to be forwarded to output1. A value of 0.5 means 50%.

Description

output1 (o1)

Gates from input are forwarded here if the random decision was in favour of output 1.

output2 (o2)

Gates from input are forwarded here if the random decision was in favour of output 2.
