# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## gatetool - Operate on triggers and gates, modify gatelength

### Inputs
- inputgate (ig) - Gate input
  - Type: gate
  - Description: Input gate signal where the length/duration of high state is relevant

- inputtrigger (it) - Trigger input
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: Input trigger signal where only the start of the trigger is relevant

- inputedge (ie) - Edge input
  - Type: edge
  - Description: Input for detecting low/high or high/low transitions

- gatelength (gl) - Gate duration
  - Type: float
  - Description: Sets output gate length in seconds, or in clock tick fractions if taptempo is used

- gatestretch (s) - Length multiplier
  - Type: float
  - Default: 0.0
  - Description: Extends input gate length by percentage. Ignored if gatelength is used.

- mingatelength (m) - Minimum duration
  - Type: float
  - Default: 0.01
  - Description: Minimum output gate length in seconds or clock ticks

- maxgatelength (x) - Maximum duration
  - Type: float
  - Description: Maximum output gate length in seconds or clock ticks

- taptempo (tt) - Clock reference
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: Reference clock for timing. Makes gatelength/min/max relative to clock ticks.

### Outputs
- outputgate (og) - Gate output
  - Type: gate
  - Description: Gate output with controllable length for each input event

- outputtrigger (ot) - Trigger output
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: 10ms trigger output for each input event

- outputedge (oe) - Edge output
  - Type: binary
  - Description: Toggles between 0/1 for each input event

Note: Utility circuit for processing and converting between different types of timing signals. Key features:
- Three input types: gate, trigger, edge
- Corresponding outputs for each type
- Configurable gate length modification
- Clock-synchronized timing option
- Gate length bounds control

Example applications:
- Converting between gate/trigger/edge signals
- Clock division (using edge output)
- Gate length modification
- Filter pinging with zero-length impulses
- Clock-synchronized gate generation
