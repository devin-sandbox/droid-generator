Input

Type

rate (ra)

Default

Description

0.0

Frequency control: The default frequency of the LFO is 1 Hz (one cycle per second). Each volt doubles the frequency.
So an input of 1 V (a number of 0.1) speeds up the LFO to 2 Hz, 2 V (0.2) create 4 Hz and so on. On the other hand
negative voltages reduce the speed, so -1 V (-0.1) will give 0.5 Hz and so on.
Feed a reference clock here and the LFO will run at the speed of that clock – albeit optionally modiﬁed by rate and hz.
Please see page 23 for details on using taptempo inputs.

taptempo (tt)

hz ()

1.0

Set the frequency in Hz directly by setting a number here. Note: you cannot use hz at that same time as taptempo.
But both can be combined with rate.

level (l)

1.0

The maximum positive output level of the LFO. The default of 1.0 means a swing between 0 V and 10 V – unless you
enable bipolar, in which case it moves from -10 V to 10 V.

0.0

Randomization is an experimental new feature that combines random voltages with an LFO. If you turn this parameter
up, then for each hill of the LFO’s waveform output a new random attenuation is being chosen and multiplied with the
current level. The result is an output, where each cycle of the waveform has a different level.

offset (of)

0.0

The output of the LFO is shifted by that voltage right before the output. This is the same as adding or mixing a ﬁxed
voltage to the output. Not very fancy, but practical if you want to output a modulation voltage within a certain range.

bipolar (b)

0

If this switch is set to on, then the LFO will output a full swing from -level to +level. When set to off it will swing
between 0V and +level.

randomize (r)

0

1

phase (p)

0

1

0.0

Shift the LFOs phase by this value. A value of 0.0 leaves the LFO run in its normal phase. 0.5 will shift bei 180◦ . And
1.0 will shift by a complete phase of 360◦ , which is the same as 0.0.

pulsewidth (pw)

0 0.5 1

0.5

This sets the pulse width of the square LFO and only affects the output square. It ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. Please note
that a pulse width of exactly 0.0 or 1.0 will make the output stick to the respective lower or upper level.

skew (sk)

0 0.5 1

0.5

Modiﬁes the symmetry of the triangle output by shifting the “peak” of the triangle left and right. The default of 0.5
creates a symmetric waveform. Smaller values speed up the rising part of the triangle and create more and more a
ramp like waveform until a skew of 0.0 creates an exact ramp – just the same as the ramp output. A skew of 1.0 create
a sawtooth waveform.
A positive trigger edge at this input will reset the LFO. It will force to restart the waveform at its “beginning”. By using
the input syncphase you can change that behaviour.

sync (sy)

0.0

This input changes the behaviour of the sync input. I changes the phase the waveform restarts at when it receives a
sync trigger. E.g. by setting this to 0.5 a sync trigger will restart the waveform right at its middle. This is an interesting
feature that cannot be found in analog LFOs since it would be very hard to build in actual circuits.

Default

Description

0.0

If you use output – rather than the individual waveform outputs like square, saw and so on – this input selects the Wave
form. An integer number from 0 to 6 selects one of the seven available waveforms. Any number in between selects a
mixture of the two neighboring waveforms. That way you can smoothly morph through all the available waveforms.
The codes for the waveforms are:

6

Description

output (o)

Main output of the LFO.

square (q)

A square waveform – modiﬁed by pulsewidth.

sawtooth (st)

Outputs a sawtooth waveform – i.e. a rising ramp

triangle (t)

Outputs a triangle waveform – modiﬁed by skew.

ramp (rp)

Outputs a falling ramp – like a sawtooth that is mirrored. Note: if the LFO is set to bipolar then this is the negation of
sawtooth. If it is set to unipolar then this is not the case. The waveform will be positive then!

paraboloid (pb)

An experimental waveform that looks very similar to a sine wave but is derived from a triangle by computing the square
of each waypoint’s distance to level.

sine (si)

A sine waveform.

cosine (cs)

A sine waveform shifted by 90◦ . This output is for your convenience and avoids needing two LFO circuits in cases
where you want to make quadrature applications. Please note that 180◦ and 270◦ can easily be achieved by negating
the outputs sine and cosine at a later stage.
