Output of the continous input CV

Description

Output of the discrete number

gateout1 ... gateout8
(go)

Output of the gates

overflow (ov)

When the internal memory of the tape is exceeded and data got lost, this gate goes to 1 for 0.5 seconds. If you are
suspecting this situation, you can wire this output to an LED and observe the memory status that way.

sample – Sample & Hold Circuit

This is a simple sample & hold circuit. Each
time a positive trigger is seen at the jack
sample a new value is sampled from input
and sent to the output.

Description

0.0

Input signal to be sampled

sample (sm)

A positive trigger here will read the current value from input and store it internally.

gate (g)

This is an alternative way of making the circuit take a sample from the input. Here it is sampling all the time while the
gate is high. In that way it is a bit like bypass. But as soon as the gate goes low again, the output sticks to the last
sample value just before that.

timewindow (tw)

0.0

This optional parameter helps tackling a problem that many (non-analog) sequencers show: often their pitch CV is not
at its ﬁnal destination value at the time their gate is being output. Often you see a very short “slew” ramp of say 5 ms
after the gate. During that time the pitch CV moves from its former to the new value.
Now if you trigger the sample circuit with the sequencer’s gate you will essentially sample the previous pitch CV instead
of the new one. Or maybe something in between.
Now the timewindow parameter introduces a short time window after the sample trigger. During that time period the
sample & hold circuit will constantly adapt to a changed input CV (is essentially in bypass mode). When that time is
over, the input is ﬁnally frozen.
The timewindow parameter is in seconds. So when you set timewindow to say 0.005 (which means 5 ms), you give the
input CV 5 ms time for settling to its ﬁnal value after a trigger to sample before freezing it.
While this gate input is high, the circuit is bypassed and input is copied to output.

select – Copy a signal if selected

Copies a value just when the circuit is selected via select.
This solves the problem of having an LED
displaying something, but just when a certain “menu page” or similar is active. Simply setting the LED with copy (see page 172) or some
other circuit’s output will always set it. Checking some

DROID manual for blue-6

Here is an example of letting the LED L1.1 ﬂash when
_SELECTED is high, and otherwise don’t copy anything to
the LED:

Default

select (s)

output (o)

select state and sending 0 does not help, since it will
override any other circuit’s values for the LED even when
those are selected.

[lfo]
output = _FLASH
[select]
select = _SELECT
input = _FLASH
output = L1.1

The select input allows you to overlay buttons and LEDs with multiple functions. If you use this input, the circuit will
process the buttons and LEDs just as if select has a positive gate signal (usually you will select this to 1). Otherwise
it won’t touch them so they can be used by another circuit. Note: even if the circuit is currently not selected, it will
nevertheless work and process all its other inputs and its outputs (those that do not deal with buttons or LEDs) in a
normal way.
This input makes the select input more ﬂexible. Here you specify at which value select should select this circuit.
E.g. if selectat is 0, the circuit will be active if select is exactly 0 instead of a positive gate signal. In some cases this
is more conventient.

Description
The input will be copied here, but just when the circuit is selected via select.
