cvlooper – Clocked CV looper

Easy to use clocked CV looper that also
loops an additional gate and can do overlay and overdub.
This circuit is a very easy to use CV looper.
It records an incoming CV (and optionally
a gate as well) on a virtual tape loop with a resolution of
one sample per ms. The length of this tape is eight seconds. If you need a longer loop time, you can reduce the
tape speed. At a speed of 0.5 you have a maximum loop
time of 16 seconds and a resolution of one sample per
2 ms (which is still pretty decent for most applications).
This looper is meant to be playable in a live situation as
easily as possible. For that purpose it does not implement the typical loop start → loop stop scheme – which
requires the musician to know beforehand that she will
start a loop. Instead the looper is always recording. The
loop length is speciﬁed in clock ticks. And as soon as the
looping is activated, the previous x clock ticks of CV information will be repeated over and over.
Here is an example for a simple looper for one CV without
a gate:
[button]
button
led

= B1.1
= L1.1

[cvlooper]
cvin
= I1
clock
= I8
cvout
= O1
length
= 16
loopswitch = L1.1

# steady clock
# 16 clock ticks

The button B1.1 is converted into a toggle button for activating the looping. The CV is read from I1 and is sent to

O1. As long as the loop switch is off the looper is in bypass mode and simply copies I1 to O1. At the same time
it is always recording to its internal endless tape. When
the loop switch is switched on, the last 16 clock ticks of
CV information is looped to O1 and I1 is ignored.

Please note: for your convenience the exact time when
the loop switch is switched on is quantized to the nearest
clock tick – may it be in the future or past. This makes
playing exactly in time much easier.
The second example adds a gate signal – such as output by a ribbon controller. The gate is running through
I2→O2.

led

Toggle buttons would ﬁt nicely for these two functions.
Please note: you always need a clock! The CV looper is
useless without one. If you do not want to use an external clock, you can make use of the LFO circuit for creating
an internal clock.
What if you want to loop more than one CV? Just create
more cvlooper circuits – one for each CV. And control
them from the same set of buttons.

the output. The tape’s content stays untouched.
This allows you to overlay the loop CV with your
own from time to time.
2. On the other hand, when overdub is on and the input gate is active, the input CV will be written to the
tape and replaces the recorded CV at those places.
And it also will be routed to the output at the same
time.

Changing the tape or clock speed
# steady clock

# 16 clock ticks

Using a gate changes the behaviour of the CV looper. The
state of gatein (not the exact voltage) is being looped as
well. The CV is recorded to the tape only while the gate is
high.
Using a gate makes two additional features possible:
1. When overlay is on and the input gate is active,
the input CV will override that on the tape and instead the source signal from cvin is bypassed to

It is possible to change the tape speed on the ﬂy in order
to slow down or speed up the recorded loop’s content. It
is important – however – to always change the tape speed
and clock speed at the same time and in the same manner.
Otherwise you will get stuttering effects. So if you double the tapespeed you also need to double the frequency
of the clock.

Changing the length
Changing length parameter on the ﬂy is supported and
just works. Remember: it does not set the length of the
tape loop but just the length of that part that is played

back. The recording is always done with the maximum
length. So if you increase the length while playing back
you will get access to the older parts of the CV history
that way. Just don’t make the length longer than the actual tape (see below).

Limitations
1. The value range of cvin and cvout is -1 … +1 – or -10 V
… +10 V. If that range is not sufﬁcient for you, you need to
scale it yourself. For example you could divide the value
by 10 before sending it to cvin and multiply it with 10 after it arrives at cvout:

Input

Type

[cvlooper]
cvin = _INPUT_CV / 10
cvout = _OUT
...

3. The total loop length can be 128 clock ticks at most. If
you need more ticks, you can divide the input clock down,
using clocktool:

[copy]
input = _OUT * 10
output = _OUTPUT_CV

[clocktool]
clock
divide
output

= G1
= 2
= _LOOP_CLOCK

2. Memory (RAM) is a valuable resource. The CV looper
limits itself to 8000 samples in order not to waste too
much memory and leave space for other circuits as well
(the Droid master has about 100.000 bytes of memory
and 8000 samples need 16.000 bytes). But if you want
to make longer loops, you can reduce the tape speed and
thus use less samples per second.

Default

Description

cvin (ci)

0.0

Input CV that should be looped.

gatein (gi)

1

Optional input gate. If you do not patch something here, the gate is assumed to be always high.

clock (c)

Input clock. The clock is mandatory and is the base for the deﬁnition of the loop length. Also the loop switch is quantized in time to the nearest clock.

reset (r)

A trigger here resets the playback head immediately to the start of the loop, if you are in playback mode.
16

Length of the loop in clock ticks. Example: You get a length of 16 ticks by patching the number 16 to length. If you
want to set the length by means of an external CV that would require 160 Volts. So you need to multiply your input by
some useful number in that case.

tapespeed (s)

1.0

Relative tape speed, where 1.0 is the normal speed. So a value of 0.5 slows down the speed thus increasing the effective tape length from 8 to 16 seconds while reducing the sampling rate from 1 ms to 2 ms per sample. Changing the
tape speed on the ﬂy probably leads to interesting results.

Mandatory parameter: While the loop switch is off the CV looper simply sends all input CV and gate to their respective
outputs. At the same time CV and gate are also recorded to the tape. When the loop switch is on, the CV and gate are
being read from the tape, instead. The input CV and gate are now ignored.

Input

Default

Description

pause (p)

off

This is a binary input. If you send a high signal here, the looper pauses. This is only works in playback mode. The
current CV value is hold the entire time. This is not the same as bypass, since in bypass mode the original CV will be
routed through.

overlay (ov)

off

Overlaying changes the behaviour while looping is active. If overlay is set to on, while the input gate is active the gate
and CV will be sent directly from the inputs rather than read from the tape.

overdub (od)

off

Overdubbing also changes the behaviour during the looping: If it is active then while the input gate is high the input
gate and CV will be written to the tape – thus changing the loop on the ﬂy.

bypass (b)

off

Setting bypass to on copies the input CV and gate from their inputs to their outputs while keeping the loop’s content
untouched. This disabled the looping for the while, but you can get back to it later. Note: this is different from turning
off the loop switch, because then your tape’s content would be overwritten.
