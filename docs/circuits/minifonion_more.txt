If you set this gate input to 1 then quantization is bypassed and the input voltage is directly copied to the output.

0

Set the root note here. 0 means C, 1 means C♯, 2 means D and so on. If you multiply the value of an input like I1 with
120, then you can use a 1V/Oct input for selecting the root note via a sequencer, MIDI keyboard or the like. Also then
you are compatible with the ROOT CV input of the Sinfonion.
