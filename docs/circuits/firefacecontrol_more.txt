firefacecontrol – Control a RME Fireface interface (experimental)

This experimental circuit allows you to
control the most import volumes and
mixes of an RME Fireface audio interface.
It’s also a perfect match for the M4 motor
fader units. You need an X7 in order to use
this circuit.

problem is that the MIDI implementation of the Fireface
is more designed for user interaction via a Mackie Control
and not for general automation. This is very sad.

Please note that this circuit is still experimental. Its main

For example there is a MIDI CC for changing the panning
of a channel. But instead of simply having the CC going
from 0 (left) via 64 (mid) to 127 (right), it uses various CC
values as commands for modiﬁying the existing panning

by some ﬁxed value to the left or to the right. So without
knowing the current setting, it’s not possible to send the
correct CC commands. And for
there is no way to
know, since MIDI is a one way communication.

The select input allows you to overlay buttons and LEDs with multiple functions. If you use this input, the circuit will
process the buttons and LEDs just as if select has a positive gate signal (usually you will select this to 1). Otherwise
it won’t touch them so they can be used by another circuit. Note: even if the circuit is currently not selected, it will
nevertheless work and process all its other inputs and its outputs (those that do not deal with buttons or LEDs) in a
normal way.

Description
This input makes the select input more ﬂexible. Here you specify at which value select should select this circuit.
E.g. if selectat is 0, the circuit will be active if select is exactly 0 instead of a positive gate signal. In some cases this
is more conventient.
