# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## sample - Sample & Hold Circuit

### Inputs
- input - Signal input
  - Type: float
  - Default: 0.0
  - Description: Input signal to be sampled

- sample - Trigger input
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: Captures input value on positive edge

- gate - Gate input
  - Type: gate
  - Description: Samples continuously while high
  - Note: Holds last value when gate goes low

- timewindow - Settling time
  - Type: float
  - Default: 0.0
  - Description: Time window after trigger for input settling
  - Note: Useful for sequencer CV timing issues

- bypass - Bypass control
  - Type: gate
  - Description: Copies input directly to output when high

### Outputs
- output - Sampled value
  - Type: float
  - Description: Most recently captured input value

Note: Basic sample & hold utility with features:
- Trigger or gate-based sampling
- Input settling window
- Bypass functionality
- Continuous or discrete sampling
- Sequencer compensation
- Last value retention

Example applications:
- CV sampling
- Sequencer timing compensation
- Random voltage capture
- Gate-controlled sampling
- Signal freezing
- Value memory

Limitations:
- Single input channel
- Fixed trigger behavior
- No slew limiting
- No internal noise
- No track/hold mode
