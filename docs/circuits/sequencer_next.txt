You can make the chain longer by adding more sequencer
circuits. All but the last must have chaintonext set to 1.
Here comes a 19 step sequencer:
[p2b8]
[lfo]
hz = P1.1 * 30
output = _CLOCK

pitch2 = 9
pitch3 = 14
pitch4 = 26
pitch5 = 2
pitch6 = 9
pitch7 = 14
pitch8 = 26
chaintonext = 1 # continue at next sequencer
[sequencer]
pitch1 = 3
pitch2 = 10
pitch3 = 15

Notes:
• Deﬁne all the input and output jacks like clock,
pitchoutput etc. just for the ﬁrst sequencer. All
subsequent ones just have pitch, gate, repeat,
slew and cv deﬁnitions.
• The parameter chaintonext is dynamic. You could
make or break the chain with a toggle button or
something else if you like.

Input

Type

Default

Description

clock (c)

Each trigger into this jack advances the sequence by one step.

reset (r)

A trigger here resets the sequence to the ﬁrst step

stages (sg)

1 2 3

+

steps (s)

1 2 3

0

With this input you can force the sequencer to begin from start after a certain number of clock cycles. If you omit the
parameter or if it is set to 0, the sequencer will play all stages with all repeats until it resets to the beginning.

transpose (tr)

0.0

This voltage is added to the pitch output.

outputscaling (os)

1.0

The output pitch is multiplied by this parameter.

gatelength (gl)

0

1

+

Number of inputs of pitch.., gate.., slew.., cv and repeats that should be used. If you set stages to a number
higher than the number of used inputs, all inputs will be used. If you omit this parameter, all used inputs will be used.

The length of the output gates. If it is unpatched, the original input clock is fed through 1:1 (with its own duty cycle).
When used, it is a ratio from 0.0 to 1.0 and relative to the cycle of the input clock. Setting the gatelength to 1.0
merges two adjacent gates together since there is not time left for a low gate before the next step begins.

pitch1 ... pitch8 (p)

0.0

These are the pitches of the various steps. You can put ﬁxed numbers here but also of course pots or variable inputs.
Note: The number of used input jacks deﬁnes the length of the sequence, unless you override that with stages.

cv1 ... cv8 ()

0.0

Each step has an optional CV assigned. You can use that CV for modulating something or even outputting a second
pitch information.

gate1 ... gate8 (g)

1

The gate inputs should be 0 (off) or 1 (on). For stages with a 0-gate no output gate is produced and the pitch information is kept at the previous state. Unpatched gates are considered to be on!

slew1 ... slew8 (sw)

0.0

Enables slew limiting for that stage. The input is not binary but you can set the amount of slew here – individually for
each step. 0.0 switches the slew off, higher values create slower slews.

repeat1 ... repeat8 (rp)

1.0

Set this to a positive integer number like 1, 2, and so on. It sets the number of times this stage should be repeated until
the next stage will be approached. It is currently not allowed to have 0 repeats – although this would make sense in a
future version.

chaintonext (cn)

+

Output

Type

If you set this input to 1, the next sequencer circuit’s pitch and other step inputs will be added to this sequencer. See
the general circuit notes for details.

Description

pitchoutput (po)

The pitch output. It is unquantized.

cvoutput (co)

The optional CV output, in case you use the cv1 ... cv8 inputs.
