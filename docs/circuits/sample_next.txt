Input

Type

Default

Description

playbutton (pb)

A trigger here starts or restarts the playback.

recordbutton (rb)

A trigger here starts or stops the recording.

stopbutton (sb)

A trigger here stops and ongoing playback or recording.

loop (lo)

off

Set this to 1 to enable loop mode. In loop mode the playback is restarted immediately when it’s ﬁnished.

pause (p)

off

While this is 1, playback or recording is halted (the tape stops moving for the while).

mode (m)

Using this input is an alternative to using the three button inputs. If you patch mode, the three buttons (and LED
outputs) are ignored. Instead you set the mode with this input:

1 2 3

0

Idle / stopped

1

Playback

2

Recording

Since you set the mode from “outside”, the recorder cannot switch it by itself. So if the mode is set to 1 (playback) and
the playback is ﬁnished, it stays in playback mode and continues outputting the last sample.
playbackspeed (ps)

1.0

Sets the speed of the tape during playback. 1 is normal speed, 0.5 half speed, 2 double speed, and so on. Negative
speeds are allowed an move the tape backwards. The speed 0 stops the tape.

scrub (sc)

off

If 1 enables scrubbing. Now the outputs reﬂect the tape position that is set with scrubposition.

scrubposition (sp)

0

1

0.0

Position of the tape to play when scrubbing is enabled.

trimstart (ts)

0

1

0.0

Omits a fraction of the recording at the beginning during playback and scrubbing. 0.1 omits the ﬁrst 10%.

trimend (te)

0

1

1.0

Omits a fraction of the recording at the end during playback and scrubbing. 0.8 omits the last 20% (not 80%!).

0.0

Continous input CV

cvin (ci)
numberin (ni)

1 2 3

Discrete input number in the range 0 ... 255

gatein1 ... gatein8 (gi)

Input gates

clock (c)

If you use this clock input, all time inputs are measured in clock ticks instead of seconds.

sample (sm)

If you patch this input, “triggered” mode is enabled. In this mode, the virtual tape just records a new CV on each trigger
at sample. So it just records stepped CVs, no slopes and no CV changes between the triggers.

Input

Type

timewindow (tw)

Default

Description

0.0

When in triggered mode, this optional parameter helps tackling a problem that many hardware sequencers show: often
their pitch CV is not at its ﬁnal destination value at the time their gate is being output. Often you see a very short “slew”
ramp of say 5 ms after the gate. During that time the pitch CV moves from its former to the new value.
Now if you trigger the cvtape circuit with the sequencer’s gate you will essentially sample the previous pitch CV instead
of the new one. Or maybe something in between.
The timewindow parameter conﬁgures a short time window after the trigger to trigger. During that time period the
tape will constantly adapt the last sample to a changed input CV. When that time is over, the input is ﬁnally frozen on
the tape.
The timewindow parameter is in seconds. So when you set timewindow to say 0.005 (which means 5 ms), you give the
input CV 5 ms time for settling to its ﬁnal value after a trigger to sample before freezing it.

bypass (b)

off

Setting bypass to on copies the input signals directly to the outputs, regardless of any other stuff going on.

save (sv)

Send a trigger here to save the current contents of the tape to a ﬁle on the SD card. The ﬁlename is tapeXXXX.bin,
where XXXX is replaced by the number set by filenumber.

load (ld)

Send a trigger here to load a previously saved ﬁle into the tape. Use filenumber so specify which ﬁle to load.

filenumber (f)

1 2 3

1

select (s)

1 2 3

+

selectat (sa)

1 2 3

+

Output

Type

Number of the ﬁle to load or save. The range is 0 - 9999. If filenumber is 123, the name on the SD card is
tape0123.bin. These ﬁles are shared between all recorder and delay circuits.
The select input allows you to overlay buttons and LEDs with multiple functions. If you use this input, the circuit will
process the buttons and LEDs just as if select has a positive gate signal (usually you will select this to 1). Otherwise
it won’t touch them so they can be used by another circuit. Note: even if the circuit is currently not selected, it will
nevertheless work and process all its other inputs and its outputs (those that do not deal with buttons or LEDs) in a
normal way.
This input makes the select input more ﬂexible. Here you specify at which value select should select this circuit.
E.g. if selectat is 0, the circuit will be active if select is exactly 0 instead of a positive gate signal. In some cases this
is more conventient.

Description

recordled (rl)

Is 1 during recordings.

playled (pl)

Is 1 during playback or scrubbing.

stopled (sl)

Is 1 when no playback, recording or scrubbing is going on.

Output

Type

Output of the continous input CV

cvout (co)
numberout (no)

Description

1 2 3

Output of the discrete number

gateout1 ... gateout8
(go)

Output of the gates

overflow (ov)

When the internal memory of the tape is exceeded and data got lost, this gate goes to 1 for 0.5 seconds. If you are
suspecting this situation, you can wire this output to an LED and observe the memory status that way.
