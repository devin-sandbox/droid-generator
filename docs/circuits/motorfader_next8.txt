Set the musical scale. This is a number from 0 to 107. Below are the ﬁrst 12 and most important scales. You ﬁnd a list
of all 108 scales on page 107.
0

lyd – Lydian major scale (it has a ♯4)

1

maj – Normal major scale (ionian)

2

X7 – Mixolydian (dominant seven chords)

3

sus – mixolydian with 3rd /4th swapped

4

alt – Altered scale

5

hm5 – Harmonic minor scale from the 5th

6

dor – Dorian minor (minor with ♯13)

7

min – Natural minor (aeolian)

8

hm – Harmonic minor (♭6 but ♯7)

9

phr – Phrygian minor scale (with ♭9)

10

dim – Diminished scale (whole/half tone)

11

aug – Augmented scale (just whole tones)

Note: Alltogether there are 108 scales. Please see page 107 for a complete list
select1 (s1)

Gate input for selecting the root note as being an allowed interval. When you want to create a playing interface for live
operation you can patch the output of a toggle button (made with the circuit [button]) here.
Note: When all select and selectfill inputs are 0, automatically all seven scale notes are selected, i.e. select1 ...
select13 will be set to one.

select3 (s3)
select5 (s5)
select7 (s7)
select9 (s9)

harmonicshift (has)

1 2 3

0

This input can reduce harmonic complexity by disabling some of the scale or non-scale notes. It is an idea ﬁrst found
in the Sinfonion and also provided by the circuit sinfonionlink (see page 353).
harmonicshift is staged after the select... inputs and further ﬁlters out (disables) notes based on their relation to
the current scale. This means that ﬁrst the 12 select... inputs select a subset of the 12 possible notes. After that
harmonicshift can reduce this set further (it will never add notes).

If harmonicshift is not zero, depending on its value some or more of the scale notes are disabled, even if they would
be allowed by select.... Or in other words: the harmonic material is reduced.
You also can use negative values. These create rather strange sounds by removing the simple chord functions instead
of the complex ones ﬁrst.
Here are the possible values:
