Default

Description

0V

The general pitch information on a 1 V / octave base to be used for the three VCOs.

0

The amount of octave spread between output1 and output3. At a value of 1.0 the spread is four octaves.

0.0

The amount of linear detune of VCO 2 and 3. This is not on a 1 V / octave base but corresponds to an absolute frequency
difference in Hertz. The exact frequency difference cannot be set here, since that depends on how you have tuned your
VCOs. But the rule is the following: If input is a 0 V and detune is 1.0, the detune is by four semitones. And for an
input of 1 V (one octave higher) it is just two semitones, because that results in the same frequency difference. For
2 V (two octaves up) it ist just one semitone and for 3 V half a semitone (and so on). Best thing is to simply try out and
listen!

off

Set this to 1 or on if you want to include perfect ﬁfths as intermediate steps.

Description
Outputs for the 1 V / octave of the three VCOs. output1 is an exact copy of input so you could omit that and rather
patch VCO 1 to the original pitch CV.

once – Output one trigger after the Droid has started

This circuit outputs exactly one trigger after the Droid module has started. You can
set a delay for that to happen.

Input

[once]
delay
trigger

= 0.2 # 200 ms
= _DO_ONCE

The applications are up to you. Maybe you
want to automatically start something when the Droid
starts or update some MIDI data or whatever weird other
idea you have in mind.

Default

Description

delay (dl)

0.01

Set a delay in seconds after the Droid’s start before the trigger triggers. Note: the default value is 10 ms, not zero. This
allows all attached controllers to have sent at least one update before and the real pot values etc. are available at the
circuits.

onlycoldstart (c)

0

If you set this input to 1, once just sends a trigger after a cold start, only. A cold start means that the Droid has been
powered up. Pressing the button for loading a new patch and does a warm start.

Output

outputcalibrator – Tune the calibration of your CV outputs

This circuit can be used for tuning the output precision of the CV outputs of your
master. It’s main purpose is to provide a
calibration procedure for the MASTER18.

is semi-automatic calibration procedure available in the
maintainance menu.

The eight CV outputs of the master need
to be exactly calibrated so that if you write e.g. 5 V in
your
patch, the output actually outputs 5.000 V
and not something else. This due to the slight production tolerances in electronic parts. For the MASTER there

The MASTER18 does not have CV inputs, however, so
the calibration of the CV outputs has to be done manually with a precise voltmeter. Since the MASTER18 does
not have a maintainance menu either (it does not have
LEDs on the front panel), this circuit has been introduced
to give you access to the calibration settings.

use case would be to adapt it to adapt an output to
some non-standard tracking which is not 1V/Octave.
This is a bad idea however, since this permanently destroys your correct calibration. Better is to use the circuit
calibrator (see page 150) or apply some simple math at
the outputs, if that is sufﬁcient.
In the example patches of you ﬁrmware packager you ﬁnd
an example patch that uses an E4 controller for the calibration procedure.

You can use this circuit with the MASTER, as well. One

Input

Type

Default

Description

output (o)

1 2 3

1

Select the output to calibrate. This is a number from 1 to 8.

referencepoint (r)

1 2 3

0

For each output, two voltages need to be adjusted: 0 V and 5 V. Select either 0 for 0 V or 1 for 5 V.

nudgeup (nu)

Increase the currently selected output voltage by one minimal step, to match the reference voltage.

nudgedown (nd)

Decrease the currently selected output voltage by one minimal step, to match the reference voltage.

save (sv)

A trigger here saves the changed calibration values to the internal ﬂash of the master and the the SD card.

cancel (c)

A trigger here restores the previous calibration values from the internal ﬂash.

loaddefaults (ld)

A trigger here loads the default calibration values, which are not very precise, but a good starting point if you got totally
lost.

Output

Type

Description

dirty (d)

Outputs 1 if the current calibration has been changed and needs to be saved.

calibration (cl)

Shows the difference between the current calibration of the selected output and reference voltage and its default calibration value.

uncalibrated (u)

DROID manual for blue-6

0

1

Shows you the percentage of uncalibrated outputs. If all eight outputs are calibrated (differ from the default calibration
value) this outputs 0.
