Description

righthalfinv (ri)

This outputs 1.0 - righthalf, i.e. the value range 1.0 ... 1.0 ... 0.0 when the pot moves left → mid → right (and the
scaled by outputscale).

onchange (c)

This output emits a trigger whenever the pot is turned in either direction.

quantizer – Non-musical quantizer

This quantizer circuit is very simple. It
reads an input voltage, quantizes it to the
next discrete step that you conﬁgured and
outputs it.
You can use it for musical purposes by setting the number of steps to 12 per Volt (which is default).
It will quantize the input to semitones.
The following example scales down a pot P1.1 to 1 V (i.e.
one octave) and then quantizes it to semitones. Since 12
is the default value for steps this parameter can be omit-

input = P1.1 * 1V
output = O1

You can use the Quantizer circuit as a sample & hold circuit if you set steps to 0 and use the trigger input:

Note1 : In fact you can select 13 semitones here because
if you turn the pot fully CW it will output 1, which will be
scaled to 1 V and then quantized to 1 V – which is the 13th
semitone above the lowest possible note.

Patch the unquantized input voltage here
This jack is optional. If you patch it, the quantizer will work in triggered mode. Here the output pitch is always frozen
until the next trigger happens.

12

Number of steps that one Volt should be divided in. The default is 12 and will quantize the input voltage to semitones.
The number of steps is related to a value of 1 V which means 0.1. It is allowed to use a fractional number here. E.g.
the value 1.2 will quantize to 12 steps per 10 V (which means 12 steps per 1.0, which can make sense. A value of 0 (or
lower) will basically mean an infinite number of steps and thus practically disable quantization.

0

If you set this gate input to 1 then quantization is bypassed and the input voltage is directly copied to the output.

1

This parameter selects which value is chosen if the input value lies between two allowed quantized values (which is
almost always the case). The default is to choose the nearest value.

Whenever the quantization changes to a new output value a trigger with the duration 10 ms is output here. No trigger
