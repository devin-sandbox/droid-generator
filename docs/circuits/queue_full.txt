changed (c)

Whenever the quantization changes to a new output value a trigger with the duration 10 ms is output here. No trigger
is output in bypass mode.

queue – Clocked CV shift register

This circuit implements a shift register (a
queue) with 64 cells. Each cell contains one
CV value. At each clock impulse the CVs
each move one cell forwards. The last CV
is dropped. And the current input value is
copied to the ﬁrst cell.

[queue]
input = I1
clock = I2
output4 = O4

Please note:

There are eight outputs, which you can place at any of the
64 cells you like. If you do not specify any placement, the
outputs are placed at the ﬁrst eight cells – und thus the
information in the remaining 56 cells is not being used.
The following example reads CVs from the input I1. O4 always shows the CV value that was seen at the input four
cycles previously:

[queue]
input = I1
clock = I2
outputpos1 = 3
outputpos2 = 24
outputpos3 = 64

• Since the DROID is very precise in processing CV
voltages you can use the queue in order to delay
melodies from sequencers etc.
• As always also the inputs outputpos1 ...
outputpos8 may be CV controlled and change
in time.

Description

0.0

This CV will be pushed into the ﬁrst cell of the shift register whenever a clock occurs.
Each clock signal at this jack will move the CV content from every cell of the shift register to the next cell. The CV in
the last cell will be dropped.

Speciﬁes the position of each of the eight outputs – i.e. which cell of the shift register it should output. Allowed are
values from 1 up to 64. These jacks defaults to 1, 2, ... 8, so if you do not wire them the eight outputs reﬂect the ﬁrst
eight positions of the shift register.

Description
Eight outputs for eight different positions of the register. If you do not wire outputpos1 ... outputpos8, these outputs
show the content of the 1st , 2nd , ... 8th cell.

random – Random number generator

A random number generator with clocked
and unclocked mode, that can either create
voltages at discrete steps and completely
free values.

the maximum possible speed (about 6000 times per second).
Simple example for clocked random numbers between
0.0 and 1.0 (1.0 translates into 10 V at the output):

This circuit creates random numbers between two tunable levels minimum and maximum. In
clocked mode each clock creates and holds a new random
value. In unclocked mode the random values change at

then there is no random any more since there is only one allowed step (which is the average between minimum and
