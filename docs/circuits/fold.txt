# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## fold - CV folder - keep (pitch) CV within certain bounds

### Inputs
- input (i) - Input signal
  - Type: float
  - Description: Input CV to be folded within bounds

- foldby (fb) - Fold increment
  - Type: float
  - Description: Amount to add/subtract when folding (e.g., 1V for octave folding)

- minimum (min) - Lower bound
  - Type: float
  - Description: Lower boundary for folding. Values below this will be folded up by foldby increments.

- maximum (max) - Upper bound
  - Type: float
  - Description: Upper boundary for folding. Values above this will be folded down by foldby increments.

### Outputs
- output (o) - Folded signal
  - Type: float
  - Description: Input signal folded to stay within minimum and maximum bounds

Note: Keeps CV signals within defined bounds by folding rather than limiting. Key features:
- Configurable fold increment (e.g., 1V for octave folding)
- Optional minimum/maximum bounds
- Asymmetric folding behavior when min > max
- Useful for pitch CV containment

Special behaviors:
- If minimum or maximum is omitted, no folding occurs at that boundary
- If space between min/max is less than foldby, some values may remain outside bounds
- When min > max, upward folding takes precedence

Example applications:
- Keeping pitch CV within specific octave range
- Containing modulation signals within bounds
- Creating repeating patterns from linear signals
- Octave transposition of pitch CV
