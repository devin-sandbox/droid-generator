# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## chord - Chord generator

### Inputs
- pitch (p) - Base pitch
  - Type: V/Oct
  - Default: 0V
  - Description: Sets the minimum pitch of the lowest note of the chord

- spread (s) - Note spread
  - Type: V/Oct
  - Default: 0V
  - Description: Range between lowest and highest note (0V=one octave, 1V=two octaves)

- inversion (iv) - Chord inversion
  - Type: integer
  - Default: 0
  - Description: 0=auto, 1-4 forces specific note as lowest (1=root, 2=second, etc)

- trigger (t) - Update trigger
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: none
  - Description: Optional - freezes outputs until triggered when connected

- root (ro) - Root note
  - Type: integer
  - Default: 0
  - Description: Sets root note (0=C, 1=C#, etc., up to 11=B)

- degree (dg) - Scale selection
  - Type: integer
  - Default: 0
  - Description: Selects musical scale (0-107, e.g., 0=Lydian, 1=Major, 7=Natural minor)

- select1 (s1) - Root note select
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: none
  - Description: Gate input for selecting root note as interval

- select3 (s3) - Third select
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: none
  - Description: Gate input for selecting the 3rd

- select5 (s5) - Fifth select
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: none
  - Description: Gate input for selecting the 5th

- select7 (s7) - Seventh select
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: none
  - Description: Gate input for selecting the 7th

- select9 (s9) - Ninth select
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: none
  - Description: Gate input for selecting the 9th (2nd)

- select11 (s11) - Eleventh select
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: none
  - Description: Gate input for selecting the 11th (4th)

- select13 (s13) - Thirteenth select
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: none
  - Description: Gate input for selecting the 13th (6th)

- selectfill1 (sf1) - Alt ninth
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: off
  - Description: Selects alternative 9th not in scale

- selectfill2 (sf2) - Alt third
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: off
  - Description: Selects alternative 3rd not in scale

- selectfill3 (sf3) - Alt fifth
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: off
  - Description: Selects alternative 4th/5th (usually diminished 5th)

- selectfill4 (sf4) - Alt thirteenth
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: off
  - Description: Selects alternative 13th not in scale

- selectfill5 (sf5) - Alt seventh
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: off
  - Description: Selects alternative 7th not in scale

- harmonicshift (has) - Harmonic complexity
  - Type: integer
  - Default: 0
  - Description: Reduces harmonic complexity by disabling notes (-7 to 7)

### Outputs
- output1 (o1) - First voice
  - Type: V/Oct
  - Description: Pitch CV for first voice of chord

- output2 (o2) - Second voice
  - Type: V/Oct
  - Description: Pitch CV for second voice of chord

- output3 (o3) - Third voice
  - Type: V/Oct
  - Description: Pitch CV for third voice of chord

- output4 (o4) - Fourth voice
  - Type: V/Oct
  - Description: Pitch CV for fourth voice of chord (optional)

Note: This circuit generates up to 4 voices of musical chords with flexible note selection, inversions, and harmonic complexity control. Supports 2, 3, or 4-voice modes automatically based on connected outputs.
