Input

Default

Description

pause (p)

off

This is a binary input. If you send a high signal here, the looper pauses. This is only works in playback mode. The
current CV value is hold the entire time. This is not the same as bypass, since in bypass mode the original CV will be
routed through.

overlay (ov)

off

Overlaying changes the behaviour while looping is active. If overlay is set to on, while the input gate is active the gate
and CV will be sent directly from the inputs rather than read from the tape.

overdub (od)

off

Overdubbing also changes the behaviour during the looping: If it is active then while the input gate is high the input
gate and CV will be written to the tape – thus changing the loop on the ﬂy.

bypass (b)

off

Setting bypass to on copies the input CV and gate from their inputs to their outputs while keeping the loop’s content
untouched. This disabled the looping for the while, but you can get back to it later. Note: this is different from turning
off the loop switch, because then your tape’s content would be overwritten.

dac – DA Converter with 12 bits

This circuit converts a binary representation of up to 12 bits into an output value in
a given range. Consider the following example:
[dac]
bit1 = I1
bit2 = I2
bit3 = I3
output = O1

[dac]
bit1 = I1
bit2 = I2
bit3 = I3
minimum = 0.1 # 1V
maximum = 0.5 # 5V
output = O1

Now the table looks like this:

In this example three bits are being used.
Three bits can represent a number from 0 to 7. These are
mapped to the input range from 0 to 1 (or 0 V to 10 V) in
the following way:

In other words: this circuit will convert three different
gate inputs into one analog output value. bit1 has the
most inﬂuence, but3 the least.

If you use more of the bit-outputs you get more resolution. For example if you use bit1 ... bit8, the total range
will be divided into 256 possible output values. The maximum is 12 bits. Since bit 1 is the most signiﬁcant bit,
adding more and more bits will not change the inﬂuence
of the already used bits.
Please also have a look at the circuit adc (see page 113,
which does the exact opposite!

The normal output range is 0 to 1 (i.e. 10 V) per default,
but you can change that with the parameters minimum
and maximum. For example you could have the three bits
mapped to just the range of 0.1 to 0.5:

This sets the lower bound of the output range, i.e. the value that the bit sequence 000000000000 will produce.

maximum (x)

This sets the upper bound of the output value, i.e. the value that the bit sequence 111111111111 will produce.

you actually patch.
