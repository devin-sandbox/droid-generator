# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## slew - CV Slew Limiter

### Inputs
- input - Signal input
  - Type: float
  - Description: CV signal to apply slew limiting to

- slew - Slew rate
  - Type: float
  - Default: 1.0
  - Description: Controls slew rate (0.0 disables, higher values = slower)
  - Note: In linear mode, value is seconds needed for 1V change

- slewup - Rising slew multiplier
  - Type: float
  - Default: 1.0
  - Description: Multiplies slew rate for rising voltages

- slewdown - Falling slew multiplier
  - Type: float
  - Default: 1.0
  - Description: Multiplies slew rate for falling voltages

- gate - Enable control
  - Type: gate
  - Description: When patched, slew limiting only active while high

### Outputs
- exponential - Exponential slew
  - Type: float
  - Description: Classical capacitor-like exponential curve
  - Note: Fast initial change, slower near target

- linear - Linear slew
  - Type: float
  - Description: Constant rate voltage change
  - Note: Fixed maximum rate of change

- scurve - S-curve slew
  - Type: float
  - Description: Accelerating/decelerating curve
  - Note: Similar to trombone player movement

Note: Advanced slew limiter with features:
- Three distinct algorithms
- Independent up/down rates
- Gate-controlled activation
- Musical timing control
- Voltage-controlled rates
- Multiple output types

Example applications:
- Pitch glide effects
- Envelope smoothing
- CV transition control
- Musical articulation
- Parameter morphing
- Motion simulation

Limitations:
- No tempo sync
- No curve shape control
- Fixed algorithm types
- No feedback path
- No modulation inputs
- No state memory
