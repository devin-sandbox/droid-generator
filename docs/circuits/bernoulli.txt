# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## bernoulli - Random gate distributor

### Inputs
- input (i) - Input gate/trigger signal
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: 0
  - Description: Send gate or trigger signals here

- distribution (di) - Probability distribution
  - Type: float
  - Default: 0.5
  - Description: Controls the probability of a gate being forwarded to output1 (0.0-1.0, where 0.5 means 50%)

### Outputs
- output1 (o1) - First output
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: Gates from input are forwarded here if the random decision favors output 1

- output2 (o2) - Second output
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: Gates from input are forwarded here if the random decision favors output 2

Note: On each positive trigger edge at input, a new random decision is made. The chosen output receives an exact copy of the input signal (including complex signals like envelopes). The other output sends 0V.
