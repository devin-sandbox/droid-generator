matrixmixer – Matrix mixer for CVs

This circuit is a 4×4 matrix mixer with four
inputs and four outputs that is operated by
push buttons. Each of the 16 matrix nodes
has a toggle button for adding or removing
one speciﬁc input to or from one speciﬁc
output. The mixing is always done with unity gain. This
means that each output is the sum of all inputs that are
enabled on its path.

As an alternative operation, instead of summing the enabled signals you can compute the maximum signal. This
is useful when combining envelope signals – e.g. from different rhythmic patterns. Adding envelope signals would
either make them “too loud” or even distort them.

The following picture shows a matrix with the four inputs
I1 … I4 and the four outputs O1 … O4. As you can see the
button 23 mixes input 2 to output 3.

Of course it is possible to use a smaller part of the matrix,
e.g. just 3×2, simply by not patching the according inputs, outputs and buttons. Here is an example of a 3×2
mixer:

The current state of the sixteen buttons is saved in the
’s internal ﬂash memory.

If you have not pushed any buttons yet, the mixer enables
four buttons in a diagonal so that inputs I1 is connected
to output O1 and so on:

Mixers with more inputs / outputs
The four auxiliary inputs auxin1 … auxin4 can be used to
create matrix mixers with more than four inputs. You can

Input

Type

input1 ... input4 (i)

create a mixer with 8 inputs and 4 outputs by sending the
four outputs of one matrix mixer into the four auxiliary
inputs of a second one.

Default

Description

0.0

The up to four CV inputs that you want to mix

If you want to create a mixer with more than 4 outputs
then simply use several mixers and feed the same inputs
to all of them.

These auxiliary inputs will be mixed directly into the four outputs output1 … output4 and are used for cascading several
matrix mixers into one with more than four inputs.

If this is 0.0, normal mixing is done (the enabled inputs CVs will be added). At a value of 1.0 instead each outputs is the
maximum of the enabled inputs. Any number in between will create a weighted average between these two values.

This input selects in which state the matrix begins life. Also a trigger to clear will create that starting state. The
following three conﬁgurations can be selected with startvalue:

All buttons are cleared.

The buttons on the diagonal are active.

2

All buttons are set.

When set to 1, input1 is sent to output1, input2 to output2 and so on.
button11 ... button14
(b1)

These four buttons decide, to which of the four outputs input1 is being mixed.

button21 ... button24
(b2)

These four buttons decide, to which of the four outputs input2 is being mixed.

button31 ... button34
(b3)

These four buttons decide, to which of the four outputs input3 is being mixed.

button41 ... button44
(b4)

These four buttons decide, to which of the four outputs input4 is being mixed.

The select input allows you to overlay buttons and LEDs with multiple functions. If you use this input, the circuit will
process the buttons and LEDs just as if select has a positive gate signal (usually you will select this to 1). Otherwise
it won’t touch them so they can be used by another circuit. Note: even if the circuit is currently not selected, it will
nevertheless work and process all its other inputs and its outputs (those that do not deal with buttons or LEDs) in a
normal way.

Description
This input makes the select input more ﬂexible. Here you specify at which value select should select this circuit.
E.g. if selectat is 0, the circuit will be active if select is exactly 0 instead of a positive gate signal. In some cases this
is more conventient.
This is the preset number to save or to load. Note: the ﬁrst preset has the number 0, not 1! For the whole story on
presets please refer to page 21. This circuit has 16 presets, so this number ranges from 0 to 15.

loadpreset (lp)

A trigger here loads a preset. As a speciality you can use the trigger for selecting a preset at the same time.

savepreset (sp)

A trigger here saves a preset.

clear (cl)

A trigger here loads the default start state into the circuit. The presets are not affected, unless you use direct preset
switching with the preset input and without triggers. And that case the current preset is also cleared.

clearall (ca)

A trigger here loads the default start state into the circuit and into all of its presets.
