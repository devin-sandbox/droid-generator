# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## mixer - CV Mixer

### Inputs
- input1...input8 (i) - Mixing inputs
  - Type: float
  - Default: 0.0
  - Description: Up to 8 CV inputs for mixing
  - Note: Unpatched inputs behave differently for min/max/avg operations

### Outputs
- output (o) - Mixed output
  - Type: float
  - Description: Sum of all patched inputs

- maximum (x) - Maximum value
  - Type: float
  - Description: Maximum value among patched inputs
  - Use case: Envelope mixing without amplitude increase

- minimum (m) - Minimum value
  - Type: float
  - Description: Minimum value among patched inputs

- average (a) - Average value
  - Type: float
  - Description: Average (mean) of all patched inputs

Note: CV mixer with features:
- Up to 8 input channels
- Multiple output modes (sum/max/min/avg)
- Unpatched inputs handled specially
- CV-controlled mixing possible

Example applications:
- Audio mixing
- CV combining
- Envelope mixing
- Signal averaging
- Maximum/minimum detection
- Multi-channel processing

Limitations:
- Maximum 8 inputs per instance
- Unpatched inputs affect min/max/avg differently
- No individual channel mutes
