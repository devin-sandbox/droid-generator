Description

selectfill1 (sf1)

off

Selects the alternative 9th (i.e. the 9th that is not in the scale.

selectfill2 (sf2)

off

Selects the alternative 3rd (i.e. the 3rd that is not in the scale).

selectfill3 (sf3)

off

Selects the alternative 4th or 5th . In most cases this is the diminished 5th .

selectfill4 (sf4)

off

Selects the alternative 13th (i.e. the 13th that is not in the scale).

selectfill5 (sf5)

off

Selects the alternative 7th (i.e. the 7th that is not in the scale).

harmonicshift (has)

1 2 3

0

This input can reduce harmonic complexity by disabling some of the scale or non-scale notes. It is an idea ﬁrst found
in the Sinfonion and also provided by the circuit sinfonionlink (see page 353).
harmonicshift is staged after the select... inputs and further ﬁlters out (disables) notes based on their relation to
the current scale. This means that ﬁrst the 12 select... inputs select a subset of the 12 possible notes. After that
harmonicshift can reduce this set further (it will never add notes).

If harmonicshift is not zero, depending on its value some or more of the scale notes are disabled, even if they would
be allowed by select.... Or in other words: the harmonic material is reduced.
You also can use negative values. These create rather strange sounds by removing the simple chord functions instead
of the complex ones ﬁrst.
Here are the possible values:

Description

noteshift (nos)

1 2 3

0

Shifts the resulting output note(s) by this number of scale notes up or down (if negative). So the output note still is
part of the scale but may be a note that is none of the selected ones. The maximum shift range is limited to -24 … +24.

selectnoteshift (sns)

1 2 3

0

Shifts the output note by this number of selected scale notes up or down (if negative). If you use noteshift at the
same time, first selectnoteshift is applied, then noteshift. The maximum shift range is limited to -24 … +24.

off

While this is 1, the circuit will output the value set by tuningpitch instead of the actual pitch. This is ment to be a
help for tuning your VCOs.

tuningmode (tm)

tuningpitch (tp)

1V
Oct

0V

This pitch CV will be output while the tuning mode is active.

transpose (tr)

1V
Oct

0V

This value is being added to the output pitch when not in tuning mode. It can be used for musical transposition or
adding a vibrato.

Here comes your quantized output voltage
Whenever the quantization changes to a new note a trigger with the duration 10 ms is output here. No trigger is output
in bypass mode.
