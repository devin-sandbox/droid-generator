harmonicshift (has)

1 2 3

0

This input can reduce harmonic complexity by disabling some of the scale or non-scale notes. It is an idea ﬁrst found
in the Sinfonion and also provided by the circuit sinfonionlink (see page 353).
harmonicshift is staged after the select... inputs and further ﬁlters out (disables) notes based on their relation to
the current scale. This means that ﬁrst the 12 select... inputs select a subset of the 12 possible notes. After that
harmonicshift can reduce this set further (it will never add notes).

If harmonicshift is not zero, depending on its value some or more of the scale notes are disabled, even if they would
be allowed by select.... Or in other words: the harmonic material is reduced.
You also can use negative values. These create rather strange sounds by removing the simple chord functions instead
of the complex ones ﬁrst.
Here are the possible values:

off – all selected notes are allowed

1

disable all ﬁll notes (non-scale notes)

2

disable ﬁlls and 11th

3

disable ﬁlls, 11th and 13th

4

disable ﬁlls, 11th , 13th and 9th

5

disable ﬁlls, 11th , 13th , 9th and 7th

6

disable ﬁlls, 11th , 13th , 9th , 7th and 3rd

-1

disable the root note

-2

Description

noteshift (nos)

1 2 3

0

Shifts the resulting output note(s) by this number of scale notes up or down (if negative). So the output note still is
part of the scale but may be a note that is none of the selected ones. The maximum shift range is limited to -24 … +24.

selectnoteshift (sns)

1 2 3

0

Shifts the output note by this number of selected scale notes up or down (if negative). If you use noteshift at the
same time, first selectnoteshift is applied, then noteshift. The maximum shift range is limited to -24 … +24.

While this is 1, the circuit will output the value set by tuningpitch instead of the actual pitch. This is ment to be a
help for tuning your VCOs.

tuningmode (tm)

tuningpitch (tp)

1V
Oct

0V

This pitch CV will be output while the tuning mode is active.

transpose (tr)

1V
Oct

0V

This value is being added to the output pitch when not in tuning mode. It can be used for musical transposition or
adding a vibrato.

The select input allows you to overlay buttons and LEDs with multiple functions. If you use this input, the circuit will
process the buttons and LEDs just as if select has a positive gate signal (usually you will select this to 1). Otherwise
it won’t touch them so they can be used by another circuit. Note: even if the circuit is currently not selected, it will
nevertheless work and process all its other inputs and its outputs (those that do not deal with buttons or LEDs) in a
normal way.
This input makes the select input more ﬂexible. Here you specify at which value select should select this circuit.
E.g. if selectat is 0, the circuit will be active if select is exactly 0 instead of a positive gate signal. In some cases this
is more conventient.
This is the preset number to save or to load. Note: the ﬁrst preset has the number 0, not 1! For the whole story on
presets please refer to page 21. This circuit has 4 presets, so this number ranges from 0 to 3.

loadpreset (lp)

A trigger here loads a preset. As a speciality you can use the trigger for selecting a preset at the same time.

savepreset (sp)

A trigger here saves a preset.

clear (cl)

A trigger here loads the default start state into the circuit. The presets are not affected, unless you use direct preset
switching with the preset input and without triggers. And that case the current preset is also cleared.

clearall (ca)

A trigger here loads the default start state into the circuit and into all of its presets.

If you set this to 1, the state of the circuit will not saved to the SD card and not loaded from the SD card when the Droid
starts.

Output

Type

Description

gate (g)

The gate output.

startofsequence (ssq)

Outputs a trigger whenever the sequencer starts playing from the beginning. This can be used for synchronizing with
other sequencers. An external reset will also cause this output to trigger.

startofpart (spa)

Outputs a trigger whenever a form part starts again. This is only interesting when you use form.

startstepout (sso)

1 2 3

Outputs the current start step. This is useful in case it has been interactively set with the buttons and you need that
information for another circuit.

endstepout (eso)

1 2 3

Outputs the current end step. This is useful in case it has been interactively set with the buttons and you need that
information for another circuit.

currentstep (cst)

1 2 3

Outputs the number of the step that is currently being played (starting from 0).

currentpage (cpg)

1 2 3

Outputs the number of the fader page that is currently played, i.e. the value you would have to feed into page in order
to see the currently being played step.

accumulator (acc)

1 2 3

The current value of the pitch accumulator (an integer number in the range 0 … 16.
