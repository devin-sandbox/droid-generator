Description

form (fo)

1 2 3

0

This is an advanced feature that allows you to slice your steps into two or three parts and create musical song forms
like AAAB or ABAC. Each of the parts A, B or C are then played according to the playmode.
The form AAAB, for example, creates a 32 step form from just 16 steps, by playing the ﬁrst 8 steps three times and
then the second 8 steps once.
The following forms are available:
0

A (forms are basically deactivated)

1

AAAB

2

AABB

3

ABAC

4

AAABAAAC

5

AB

6

AAB

Notes:
• The splitting of the steps into parts takes place after accounting for startstep and endstep.
• Forms with A, B and C split the pattern into three parts. These parts can only be of equal size if the number of
steps is dividable by 3, of course.
• The pattern AB is really not the same as A, e.g when direction is set 1 (reverse). In that case each of the parts
is played backwards, but the parts themselves move forwards on your steps.
direction (d)

0

Sets the general direction in which the sequencer moves through the steps. 0 means forwards and 1 means backwards.

pingpong (pp)

0

If set to 1, the sequencer will change the direction every time it reaches the start or end of the sequence.

Description

pattern (pt)

1 2 3

0

Selects one of a list of movement patterns. That way, the sequence steps are not played in linear order but in a more
sophisticated movement. Available pattern are:
0

→

1

two steps forward, one step backward

→→←

2

double step forward, one step backward

⇒←

3

double step forward, double step backward, single step forward

⇒⇐→

4

double step forward, single step forward, double step backward, single step forward

⇒→⇐→

5

random single step forward or backward

↔

6

go forward by a small random number of steps

→×?

7

random jump to any allowed (other) note

⇕

repeatshift (rs)

1 2 3

0

This is a number in the range -24 … +24. If you set this to non-zero, each repetition of a step shifts the played note by
that many notes within the selected scale notes. This only has effect on steps where the number of repeats is greater
than 1. Also it is only is applied when the quantize = 2.

ratchetshift (ras)

1 2 3

0

This is a number in the range -24 … +24. If you set this to non-zero, each ratchet of a step shifts the played note by
that many notes within the selected scale notes. This only has effect on steps where the number of ratchets is greater
than 1. Also it is only is applied when the quantize = 2.
If you combine ratchetshift with repeatshift, both shifts are added together. And the ratchet shifting is reset for
each repetition of the step.

accumulatorrange (ac)

1 2 3

+

Using this parameter enables the pitch accumulator. The value sets the maximum value the accumulator can get. The
maximum is 16. If you set this to 0, the fader mode for pitch randomization still is in the special mode where the upper
four positions control the impact of the accumulator.
Please consult the manual of motoquencer (see page 286) for details on the pitch accumulator.

constantlength (co)

Default

Description

0

This input enables a feature that (tries to) keep the actual length of the sequence constant. There are two levels. If
constantlength = 1, every change in the repeats of a step is compensated by changing the repeats in the following
steps. E.g. if you increase the number of repeats from 4 to 5 in step 3 (by moving the fader in the appropriate fader
mode), the repeats in step 4 are reduced by 1. If they are already 1, step 5 is tried an so on, until it wrap around to step
1.
The second level is constantlength = 2. Here also the skip setting of steps is honored and modiﬁed in order to keep
the length constant. A skipped step essentially has the length 0 (or 0 repeats). The componsation is now done not
only when the repeats are changed but also when skip is switched on or off on a step.
All the compensation is only active with the range that is set with the start and end step.

autoreset (ar)
metricsaver (ms)

1 2 3

0

If set to non-zero, automatically issues a reset (just like a trigger to reset) every N clock ticks.

1

The Metric Saver ™ helps you to reliably come back to your original metric and time after playing around with all sorts
of parameters that change the played number of steps in the sequence. These are: startstep, endstep (also when
changed interactively), form, direction, pingpong, pattern, autoreset and repeats and skips of individual steps.
Therefore it counts the actual number of clock cycles since the last external reset (or system start). And when all of
these features are deactivated, it snaps back the clock to the position it would have been by now if you never had
played around with all the funny stuff.
That way, during a live performance, you can safely play around with all this polymetric and otherwise time disrupting
stuff and as soon as you clean up your mess – voila: you are back on track and in sync with the rest of the “band”.
The metric saver is turned on by default. But you can disable it by setting the parameter to 0.
