Description

outputscale (os)

1.0

The output is multiplied by this value. This is just for convenience and may save a copy (see page 172) circuit in some
situations.

outputoffset (oo)

0.0

After scaling the virtual value with outputscale, this value is being added before sending the result to the output.

1

Selects the possible range of the virtual value.

mode (m)

Type

1 2 3

0

Off: the encoder is unsed, its LEDs are off

1

Normal mode: ﬁxed range between 0.0 and 1.0

2

Bipolar mode: ﬁxed range between -1.0 and 1.0

3

Positive inﬁnity: open range between 0.0 and ∞

4

Negative inﬁnity: open range between −∞ and 0.0

5

Bipolar inﬁnity: open range between −∞ and ∞

6

Circular inﬁnity: range is 0.0 … 1.0, but repeats over in both directions

This setting is ignored if discrete is in use.
Note: The mode 0 is for situations where encoders are overlayed with select and an encoder is unused. Setting mode
= 0 can be used to disable this encoder and blank its LEDs.
smooth (sm)

0.5

Unlike a potentiometer, an encoder does not output continous values but steps. If you directly wire the output of an
encoder to a CV input of an audio module, the steps might become audible.
Therefore the ﬁnal values of the encoder are smoothed out by a simulation of a low pass ﬁlter. That’s essentially the
same as in the slew circuit. The smoothing is enabled per default but you can change it with this parameter.
A value of 0.0 turns off smoothing and you get access to the tiny steps of the encoder. 1.0 selects a maximum smoothing, which has also the effect that fast turns of the encoder are slowed down a bit. The default value of 0.5 does just
a mild slew limiting.
If you use discrete, the smoothing is not applied.

discrete (d)

1 2 3

0

Set this to an integer number of 2 or higher to enable discrete mode. In this mode the encoder works like a rotary switch
for selecting one of the numbers 0, 1, 2 and so on. The number you set for discrete selects the number of positions
in this “switch”. For example discrete = 4 produces the values 0, 1, 2 or 3.
In this mode the inputs notch, mode and smooth are ignored.

snapto (sn)

Description
Use this parameter to deﬁne a position where the encoder value automatically returns to if it is not turned. This behaves
a bit like a pitch bend wheel. You can get crazy CV modulations if you use a dynamic CV for snapto, such as the output
of an LFO. The encoder’s value will try to follow the LFO but you can still turn the encoder and work “against” the LFO.
This mechanism also works if the encoder is not selected.

snapforce (sf)

0.5

Speciﬁes the speed or “force” with that the encoder moves back to the snapto position if that is used. A force of 0.0
deactivates snapto.

sensivity (se)

1.0

The sensivity determines how far you need to turn the knob to get which amout of value change. Per default one turn
of 360 degrees changes to the value from 0.0 to 1.0. A sensitivity of 2, doubles the speed of change, 0.5 slows it
down to the half.
If you use mode to enable inﬁnity, there is no total range. In this case one turn changes the value by sensivity.
If you use discrete, one turn of the knob changes the virtual switch by eight positions, if sensitivity is at 1.0, and
accordingly faster or slower if you change that.

autozoom (a)

0

1

0.0

The “auto zoom” feature allows you to ﬁne adjust values when turning the knob slowly and coarse adjust when you
turn it fast. If autozoom is at the maximum value of 1.0, turning the knob just slowly changes the value by super tiny
amounts, while turning it fast operates way faster than usual. Use any value between 0.0 and 1.0 for autozoom to
select the level of this slowing down for slow movements.
autozoom has no effect if discrete is used.

Selects whether the LED ring displays the current value with just a single colored dot (ledfill = 0) or by additionally
illuminating all LEDs between 0 and the current value in half brightness (ledfill = 1).
The select input allows you to overlay buttons and LEDs with multiple functions. If you use this input, the circuit will
process the buttons and LEDs just as if select has a positive gate signal (usually you will select this to 1). Otherwise
it won’t touch them so they can be used by another circuit. Note: even if the circuit is currently not selected, it will
nevertheless work and process all its other inputs and its outputs (those that do not deal with buttons or LEDs) in a
normal way.
This input makes the select input more ﬂexible. Here you specify at which value select should select this circuit.
E.g. if selectat is 0, the circuit will be active if select is exactly 0 instead of a positive gate signal. In some cases this
is more conventient.
This is the preset number to save or to load. Note: the ﬁrst preset has the number 0, not 1! For the whole story on
presets please refer to page 21. This circuit has 8 presets, so this number ranges from 0 to 7.

loadpreset (lp)

A trigger here loads a preset. As a speciality you can use the trigger for selecting a preset at the same time.

savepreset (sp)

A trigger here saves a preset.

clear (cl)

A trigger here loads the default start state into the circuit. The presets are not affected, unless you use direct preset
switching with the preset input and without triggers. And that case the current preset is also cleared.

clearall (ca)

A trigger here loads the default start state into the circuit and into all of its presets.

dontsave (dos)

0

Type

If you set this to 1, the state of the circuit will not saved to the SD card and not loaded from the SD card when the Droid
starts.

Description

output1 ... output8 (o)

Output the current value if the virtual encoder value (don’t use this if you are using sharewithnext).

button1 ... button8 (b)

This outputs provides you with the current states of the push buttons in the encoders, but only if the circuit is selected.
While you could do this with an extra button (see page 141) circuits, using this output is more convenient in some
situations.
