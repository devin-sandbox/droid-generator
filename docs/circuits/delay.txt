# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## delay - Tape delay for CVs, gates and numbers

### Inputs
- delay (dl) - Delay time
  - Type: float
  - Default: 1.0
  - Description: The CVs are delayed by this amount of seconds. If you patch clock as well, the delay is specified in clock tick, so then delay = 1 means "delay by one clock tick".

- cvin (ci) - CV input
  - Type: float
  - Default: 0.0
  - Description: Continuous input CV

- numberin (ni) - Number input
  - Type: int
  - Description: Discrete input number in the range 0 ... 255

- gatein1 ... gatein8 (gi) - Gate inputs
  - Type: binary
  - Description: Input gates

- clock (c) - Clock input
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: If you use this clock input, all time inputs are measured in clock ticks instead of seconds.

- sample (sm) - Sample trigger
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: If you patch this input, "triggered" mode is enabled. In this mode, the virtual tape just records a new CV on each trigger at sample.

- save - Save trigger
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: Saves the current tape content to SD card when triggered.

- load - Load trigger
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: Loads tape content from SD card when triggered.

- filenumber - File number
  - Type: int
  - Range: 1-9999
  - Description: Specifies which tape file number to save/load (e.g., tape0001.bin).

### Outputs
- cvout - CV output
  - Type: float
  - Description: Delayed version of the input CV

- numberout - Number output
  - Type: int
  - Description: Delayed version of the input number

- gateout1 ... gateout8 - Gate outputs
  - Type: binary
  - Description: Delayed versions of the input gates

Note: Experimental tape delay with 256 sample memory. CV range limited to -1...+1 (-10V...+10V). Uses intelligent interpolation for smooth CV changes. In normal mode, minimum tape length is 5.12 seconds. In triggered mode, can store up to 256 discrete steps.
