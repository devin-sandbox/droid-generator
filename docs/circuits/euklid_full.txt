Input

Type

Default

Description

noteshift (nos)

1 2 3

0

Shifts the resulting output note(s) by this number of scale notes up or down (if negative). So the output note still is
part of the scale but may be a note that is none of the selected ones. The maximum shift range is limited to -24 … +24.

selectnoteshift (sns)

1 2 3

0

Shifts the output note by this number of selected scale notes up or down (if negative). If you use noteshift at the
same time, first selectnoteshift is applied, then noteshift. The maximum shift range is limited to -24 … +24.

off

While this is 1, the circuit will output the value set by tuningpitch instead of the actual pitch. This is ment to be a
help for tuning your VCOs.

tuningmode (tm)

tuningpitch (tp)

1V
Oct

0V

This pitch CV will be output while the tuning mode is active.

transpose (tr)

1V
Oct

0V

This value is being added to the output pitch when not in tuning mode. It can be used for musical transposition or
adding a vibrato.

select (s)

1 2 3

+

selectat (sa)

1 2 3

preset (pr)

1 2 3

The select input allows you to overlay buttons and LEDs with multiple functions. If you use this input, the circuit will
process the buttons and LEDs just as if select has a positive gate signal (usually you will select this to 1). Otherwise
it won’t touch them so they can be used by another circuit. Note: even if the circuit is currently not selected, it will
nevertheless work and process all its other inputs and its outputs (those that do not deal with buttons or LEDs) in a
normal way.
This input makes the select input more ﬂexible. Here you specify at which value select should select this circuit.
E.g. if selectat is 0, the circuit will be active if select is exactly 0 instead of a positive gate signal. In some cases this
is more conventient.
This is the preset number to save or to load. Note: the ﬁrst preset has the number 0, not 1! For the whole story on
presets please refer to page 21. This circuit has 4 presets, so this number ranges from 0 to 3.

loadpreset (lp)

A trigger here loads a preset. As a speciality you can use the trigger for selecting a preset at the same time.

savepreset (sp)

A trigger here saves a preset.

clear (cl)

A trigger here loads the default start state into the circuit. The presets are not affected, unless you use direct preset
switching with the preset input and without triggers. And that case the current preset is also cleared.

clearall (ca)

A trigger here loads the default start state into the circuit and into all of its presets.

dontsave (dos)

If you set this to 1, the state of the circuit will not saved to the SD card and not loaded from the SD card when the Droid

Output

Type

Description

gate (g)

The gate output.

startofsequence (ssq)

Outputs a trigger whenever the sequencer starts playing from the beginning. This can be used for synchronizing with
other sequencers. An external reset will also cause this output to trigger.

startofpart (spa)

Outputs a trigger whenever a form part starts again. This is only interesting when you use form.

startstepout (sso)

1 2 3

Outputs the current start step. This is useful in case it has been interactively set with the buttons and you need that
information for another circuit.

endstepout (eso)

1 2 3

Outputs the current end step. This is useful in case it has been interactively set with the buttons and you need that
information for another circuit.

currentstep (cst)

1 2 3

Outputs the number of the step that is currently being played (starting from 0).

currentpage (cpg)

1 2 3

Outputs the number of the fader page that is currently played, i.e. the value you would have to feed into page in order
to see the currently being played step.

accumulator (acc)

1 2 3

The current value of the pitch accumulator (an integer number in the range 0 … 16.

euklid – Euclidean rhythm generator

This circuit creates trigger patterns according to the well-known Euclidean rhythms
and is of course CV controllable. The pattern is described by three numbers:
• The number of steps in the pattern
• The number of beats in the pattern
• An offset for shifting the beats forward
The number of beats are distributed as evenly as possible
in the pattern – but of course are all placed precisely on
clock beats. Here are a few examples of various patterns:
length: 16, beats: 4, offset: 0

Offbeats
Here is an example without CV control:

reset
length
beats
offset
output

= G1
= G2
= 16
= 5
= 0
= G3

The output offbeats does the exact opposite of
outputs: it triggers at those clock beats where output
does not. So at any given clock tick exactly either output
or offbeats triggers.

Gate length

Now let’s change that in order to make the beats controllable by the pot P1.1. Please note how the pot range is
being changed from the default 0 … 1 to the necessary
1 … 16 by using a factor of 15 and an offset of 1:

The length of the output gate is the same as that of the input gate. Also the exact voltage from the input is copied
to the output while the current step is active.

length: 16, beats: 5, offset: 0

length: 16, beats: 11, offset: 0

output

length: 13, beats: 5, offset: 0

By the way: Since the default for length is 16 and for
offset 0 you can drop those two lines if you like:

length: 16, beats: 5, offset: 1

length: 13, beats: 5, offset: 1

[euklid]

reset
beats
output

= G1
= G2
= 16
= P1.1 * 15 + 1
= 0
= G3

= G1
= G2
= P1.1 * 15 + 1
= G3

length: 4, beats: 2, offset: 1
