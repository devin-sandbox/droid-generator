Input

Type

constantlength (co)

Default

Description

0

This input enables a feature that (tries to) keep the actual length of the sequence constant. There are two levels. If
constantlength = 1, every change in the repeats of a step is compensated by changing the repeats in the following
steps. E.g. if you increase the number of repeats from 4 to 5 in step 3 (by moving the fader in the appropriate fader
mode), the repeats in step 4 are reduced by 1. If they are already 1, step 5 is tried an so on, until it wrap around to step
1.
The second level is constantlength = 2. Here also the skip setting of steps is honored and modiﬁed in order to keep
the length constant. A skipped step essentially has the length 0 (or 0 repeats). The componsation is now done not
only when the repeats are changed but also when skip is switched on or off on a step.
All the compensation is only active with the range that is set with the start and end step.

autoreset (ar)
metricsaver (ms)

1 2 3

0

If set to non-zero, automatically issues a reset (just like a trigger to reset) every N clock ticks.

The Metric Saver ™ helps you to reliably come back to your original metric and time after playing around with all sorts
of parameters that change the played number of steps in the sequence. These are: startstep, endstep (also when
changed interactively), form, direction, pingpong, pattern, autoreset and repeats and skips of individual steps.
Therefore it counts the actual number of clock cycles since the last external reset (or system start). And when all of
these features are deactivated, it snaps back the clock to the position it would have been by now if you never had
played around with all the funny stuff.
That way, during a live performance, you can safely play around with all this polymetric and otherwise time disrupting
stuff and as soon as you clean up your mess – voila: you are back on track and in sync with the rest of the “band”.
The metric saver is turned on by default. But you can disable it by setting the parameter to 0.

Switches the current meaning of the motor faders. You probably want to connect the output of a buttongroup (see
page 146) here. Here are the possible modes:

6

7

skip

Switches the current meaning of the touch buttons below the faders. You probably want to connect the output of a
buttongroup (see page 146) here. Here are the possible modes:
0

gates

1

start / end

2

gate pattern

3

skip

This setting determines wether the CV output changes every time the sequencer moves to the next step or just when
that step is active (a gate is being played). The latter is the default. But if you set this to 0, the CV values of steps
without gates will also inﬂuence the output CV.
Note: regardless of this setting, the CV will never change inbetween. Any change of the CV faders, the cvbase and
cvrange and so on will only take effect when the next step is played. This also ensures that repeats or ratchets are
always in the same pitch.

defaultcv (dc)

0.0

Set the CV the steps should be set to on a trigger to clear. That value must be within the range set by cvbase and
cvrange, or it will be truncated to that range.
If you have set cvnotches, however, the value is expected to be an integer in the range 0 ... cvnotches - 1.

Type

defaultgate (dfg)

Default

Description

1

Here you set to which state (on / off) the gates should be set on a trigger to clear.

clearskips (cs)

A trigger here removes the “skip” setting from all steps.

clearrepeats (crp)

A trigger here resets the number of repeats to 1 for each step.

clearstartend (cse)

A trigger here clears the manual settings of the start and end step. So the sequence will be played in its full length
(again) .

gatelength (gl)

0.5

The gate length in input clock cycles. A value of 0.5 thus means half a clock cycle. A steady input clock is needed
for this to work. Please note that if the gate length is >= 1.0, two succeeding notes will get a steady gate, which
essentially means legato.
If you don’t use a steady clock, set this parameter to 0. This will output a minimal gate length of about 10 ms (basically
just a trigger).

keyboard and sequencer play together, keyboard has precedence

2

mute sequencer, just play keyboard

The pitch input of a keyboard. This is used for playing along with the keyboardmode or recording with recordmode.
The gate input of a keyboard. A positive gate enabled play along (see keyboardmode) and also recording, if recordmode
is set accordingly.

keyboardgate (kg)

recordmode (rm)

This input sets how a keyboard, that is hooked to keyboardcv, and keyboardgate should be used for directly playing
notes. You can set it to 0, 1 or 2.

1 2 3

0

0

Use this input to record melodies played with a keyboard (namely keyboardcv and keyboardgate) into the sequencer.
There are three possible settings:
0

don’t record

1

record, notes longer than one step will automatically tie steps via the gate pattern

2

record, don’t tie notes. Ignore the length of the input note

When this input is set to 1 while recording, silence will be recorded while keyboardgate is off. Otherwise you can just
add notes to the sequence.
