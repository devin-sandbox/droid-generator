luckycvbase (lv)

0

0.0

This parameter affects only the operation luckycvs and luckyfaders when the fader mode is set to 0. It adds a ﬁxed
amount of CV to the random result, so that lies in the range luckycvbase … (luckycvbase + luckyamount).

1

luckyfaders (lf)

Moves the currently selected faders (according to fadermode) to new random positions. luckyamount sets the maximum value of the fader, where 1 allows the maximum.

luckybuttons (lb)

Randomly toggles the currently selected buttons (according to buttonmode). luckyamount only has an effect when
the gate patterns are selected, since here, four different values are possible. luckamount restricts them if it is lower
than 1.

luckycvs (lcv)

Replaces the affected steps’ CVs with a new random CVs. The lowest possible CV is cvbase. If luckyamount is 1, the
highest possible CV is cvbase + cvrange, otherwise it is cvbase + luckyamount × cvrange.

luckycvdrift (ld)

Modiﬁes the affected steps’ CV randomly up or down. They will stay in the CV range set by cvbase and cvrange.
luckyamount controls the amount of change.

luckyspread (lr)

First computes the average CV of all steps. Then changes the CV values of the affected steps such that their distance
to the average increases or decreases. If luckyamount is greater than 0.5, the distance is increased. Otherwise it is
decreased.

luckyinvert (li)

Inverts the CVs of the affected steps within the allowed CV range. luckyamount has no inﬂuence.

luckyrandomizecv (lrc)

Sets the “randomize CV” values of the affected steps to random values (yes, this is double randomization). The
luckyamount sets the maximum randomization value that will be set.

luckygates (lg)

Sets the gates of the affected steps randomly to on or off. The chance for on is determined by luckyamount. So with
luckyamount = 0 you clear all gates and with luckyamount = 1 you set all gates.

luckyskips (lk)

Sets the “skip this step” setting of the affected steps randomly to skip or normal. The chance for skip is determined by
luckyamount.

luckyties (lt)

Sets the “tie this step to the next” setting of the affected steps randomly to tie or normal. This is the same as setting
the gate pattern to the upper most position. The chance for tie is determined by luckyamount.

luckygatepattern (lgp)

Randomizes the gate pattern of the selected steps (there are four different values: once, all, hold and tie). Use
luckyamount to reduce that set.

luckygateprob (lga)

Sets the “randomize gate” values of the affected steps to random values (yes, this is double randomization). The
luckyamount sets the minimum randomization value that will be set (yes, this is inverted). So with luckyamount = 1
you disable randomization and make the gates play always. With luckymount = 0 you set the gate propability to the
lowest possible value (still not 0).

Description

luckyrepeats (lrp)

Randomly sets the number of repeats of the affected steps to something between 1 and 16 (the maximum). The
luckyamount determines the maximum repetition number, where 1 stands for a maximum of 16 repetitions.

luckyratchets (lrt)

Randomly sets the number of ratches of the affected steps to something between 1 and 8 (the maximum). The
luckyamount determines the maximum ratchet number, where 1 stands for a maximum of 8 ratchets.

luckyshuffle (lsh)

Randomly swaps all affected affected steps (their playing order) together will all their attributes. luckyamount has no
inﬂuence.

buttoncolor (bc)

0.1

Reverses the playin gorder of the affected steps. luckyamount has not inﬂuence.

luckyreverse (lrv)
root (ro)

DROID manual for blue-6

Set a user deﬁned color for the gate buttons. This color is only used when buttonmode = 0. The main purpose of this
option is to allow a separate color for the gate button in a linked sequencer, that does something else than gates.

1 2 3

0

Set the root note here. 0 means C, 1 means C♯, 2 means D and so on. If you multiply the value of an input like I1 with
120, then you can use a 1V/Oct input for selecting the root note via a sequencer, MIDI keyboard or the like. Also then
you are compatible with the ROOT CV input of the Sinfonion.

X7 – Mixolydian (dominant seven chords)

3

sus – mixolydian with 3rd /4th swapped

aug – Augmented scale (just whole tones)

Note: Alltogether there are 108 scales. Please see page 107 for a complete list
select1 (s1)

+

Gate input for selecting the root note as being an allowed interval. When you want to create a playing interface for live
operation you can patch the output of a toggle button (made with the circuit [button]) here.
Note: When all select and selectfill inputs are 0, automatically all seven scale notes are selected, i.e. select1 ...
select13 will be set to one.
