# DROID Circuit Documentation

This directory contains documentation for all 69 DROID circuits, including their inputs, outputs, and specifications. Each circuit is documented in its own file with standardized format:

## File Format
Each circuit documentation file includes:
- Circuit name and description
- Input parameters with types, defaults, and descriptions
- Output parameters with types and descriptions
- Usage notes and limitations
- Example applications where relevant

## Circuit Types
1. Control Circuits
   - button.txt - Button utility for controllers
   - encoder.txt - E4 controller access
   - motorfader.txt - Virtual fader control

2. Signal Processing
   - lfo.txt - Low frequency oscillator
   - mixer.txt - CV mixer
   [Additional categories to be added]

## Verification
All circuit specifications have been verified against the DROID manual to ensure:
- Parameter names match manual specifications
- Default values are correct
- Value ranges are properly documented
- All inputs and outputs are accurately described

## Usage
Reference these files when implementing DROID patches to ensure correct parameter usage and circuit configuration.
