# DROID Circuit Documentation

This directory contains documentation for all 69 DROID circuits, including their inputs, outputs, and specifications. Each circuit is documented in its own file with standardized format.

## Documentation Structure
- Individual circuit files (*.txt) containing:
  - Input parameters with types and defaults
  - Output parameters with types
  - Usage notes and limitations
  - Example applications

## Organization
The documentation is organized by circuit type and includes both basic and detailed specifications. Each circuit has:
- Base documentation (circuit.txt)
- Full documentation (circuit_full.txt)
- Additional details where applicable (circuit_more.txt, circuit_next.txt)

## Usage
Reference these files when implementing DROID patches to ensure correct parameter usage and circuit configuration. All specifications are verified against the DROID manual.
