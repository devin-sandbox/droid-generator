# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## triggerdelay - Trigger Delay with Multi-tap

### Inputs
- input - Trigger input
  - Type: trigger/gate
  - Default: 0
  - Description: Triggers/gates to be delayed

- delay - Delay time
  - Type: float
  - Default: 1.0
  - Description: Delay amount in seconds or clock cycles
  - Note: Clock-relative when clock input used

- gatelength - Gate duration
  - Type: float
  - Description: Override input gate length
  - Note: In seconds or clock cycles if clocked

- repeats - Repeat count
  - Type: integer
  - Default: 1
  - Description: Number of times to repeat delayed trigger

- mute - Mute control
  - Type: binary
  - Default: 0
  - Description: Suppresses new outputs when high

- clock - Clock input
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: Enables clock-relative timing mode

### Outputs
- output - Delayed signal
  - Type: trigger/gate
  - Description: Delayed triggers/gates with preserved length
  - Note: 10V for I1-I8, 5V for G8 expander

- overflow - Memory warning
  - Type: gate
  - Description: 0.5s gate when memory limit exceeded
  - Note: Can indicate via LED

Note: Advanced trigger delay with features:
- Up to 16 trigger memory
- Gate length preservation
- Clock synchronization
- Multiple repetitions
- Overflow detection
- Mute control

Example applications:
- Pattern shifting
- Rhythm manipulation
- Echo effects
- Clock compensation
- Gate processing
- Trigger sequencing

Limitations:
- Maximum 16 triggers in memory
- Fixed output voltage levels
- No feedback path
- No tap tempo
- No swing/shuffle
- No individual tap control
