defaultgate (dfg)

Default

Description

1

Here you set to which state (on / off) the gates should be set on a trigger to clear.

clearskips (cs)

A trigger here removes the “skip” setting from all steps.

clearrepeats (crp)

A trigger here resets the number of repeats to 1 for each step.

clearstartend (cse)

A trigger here clears the manual settings of the start and end step. So the sequence will be played in its full length
(again) .

gatelength (gl)

0.5

The gate length in input clock cycles. A value of 0.5 thus means half a clock cycle. A steady input clock is needed
for this to work. Please note that if the gate length is >= 1.0, two succeeding notes will get a steady gate, which
essentially means legato.
If you don’t use a steady clock, set this parameter to 0. This will output a minimal gate length of about 10 ms (basically
just a trigger).

1

keyboard and sequencer play together, keyboard has precedence

2

mute sequencer, just play keyboard

The pitch input of a keyboard. This is used for playing along with the keyboardmode or recording with recordmode.
The gate input of a keyboard. A positive gate enabled play along (see keyboardmode) and also recording, if recordmode
is set accordingly.

keyboardgate (kg)

recordmode (rm)

This input sets how a keyboard, that is hooked to keyboardcv, and keyboardgate should be used for directly playing
notes. You can set it to 0, 1 or 2.

0

0

Use this input to record melodies played with a keyboard (namely keyboardcv and keyboardgate) into the sequencer.
There are three possible settings:
0

don’t record

1

record, notes longer than one step will automatically tie steps via the gate pattern

2

record, don’t tie notes. Ignore the length of the input note

When this input is set to 1 while recording, silence will be recorded while keyboardgate is off. Otherwise you can just
add notes to the sequence.

Description

copy (cy)

A trigger here copies the current page of the sequence to an internal clipboard. The clipboard is not part of any preset
and is also not saved to the SD card. It can be used later for pasting it’s data to another preset or another page of a
sequence.

paste (pa)

A trigger here copies the steps from the clipboard to the current page.

pastefaders (pf)

This is like paste, but just the values of the faders of the current fadermode are copied.

pastebuttons (pb)

This is like paste, but just the values of the faders of the current buttonmode are copied. Note: the button mode “start
/ end” is not supported by copy and paste.

linktonext (ln)

0

This settings allows you to create motoquencer tracks that have more than one CV or gate output for each step. If you
set this to 1, the next motoquencer circuit in your patch will by synchronized to this one. This means that it always
plays the same step number – including all fancy operating like shiftsteps, startstep, endstep, form, pattern and
autoreset. All those inputs and also clock and reset are ignored by the next motoquencer.
The same holds for the “repeats” and “skip” setting of the steps.
fadermode and buttonmode are extended to the next motoquencers by adding 10 for each motoquencer to follow. So
fadermode = 10 will show the CV of next motoquencer in the faders. fadermode = 11 the CV randomization of the
next motoquencer. fadermode = 20 show the CV of the third linked motoquencer and so on.

Don’t set fadermode or buttonmode on the linked motoquencers. They will be ignored there.
Note: The linktonext setting cannot by dynamically changed. It needs to be ﬁxed 0 or 1. You cannot use any button
or internal cable or other methods to change it while the patch is running.

1.0

Sets tha chance for a step to be affected by the next “lucky” operation (see triggers below).

0

Determines which part of the sequence is affected by the “lucky” operations. Depending on this setting the following
steps are affected:

1.0

0

All steps between the current start and end step

1

All steps

2

All steps between start and end on the current page

3

All steps on the current page

Sets the amount of change that a “lucky” operation does to a step. The meaning depends on the operation. See the
parameters below.

Description

luckycvbase (lv)

0

0.0

This parameter affects only the operation luckycvs and luckyfaders when the fader mode is set to 0. It adds a ﬁxed
amount of CV to the random result, so that lies in the range luckycvbase … (luckycvbase + luckyamount).

1

luckyfaders (lf)

Moves the currently selected faders (according to fadermode) to new random positions. luckyamount sets the maximum value of the fader, where 1 allows the maximum.

luckybuttons (lb)

Randomly toggles the currently selected buttons (according to buttonmode). luckyamount only has an effect when
the gate patterns are selected, since here, four different values are possible. luckamount restricts them if it is lower
than 1.

luckycvs (lcv)

Replaces the affected steps’ CVs with a new random CVs. The lowest possible CV is cvbase. If luckyamount is 1, the
highest possible CV is cvbase + cvrange, otherwise it is cvbase + luckyamount × cvrange.

luckycvdrift (ld)

Modiﬁes the affected steps’ CV randomly up or down. They will stay in the CV range set by cvbase and cvrange.
luckyamount controls the amount of change.

luckyspread (lr)

First computes the average CV of all steps. Then changes the CV values of the affected steps such that their distance
to the average increases or decreases. If luckyamount is greater than 0.5, the distance is increased. Otherwise it is
decreased.

luckyinvert (li)

Inverts the CVs of the affected steps within the allowed CV range. luckyamount has no inﬂuence.

luckyrandomizecv (lrc)

Sets the “randomize CV” values of the affected steps to random values (yes, this is double randomization). The
luckyamount sets the maximum randomization value that will be set.

luckygates (lg)

Sets the gates of the affected steps randomly to on or off. The chance for on is determined by luckyamount. So with
luckyamount = 0 you clear all gates and with luckyamount = 1 you set all gates.

luckyskips (lk)

Sets the “skip this step” setting of the affected steps randomly to skip or normal. The chance for skip is determined by
luckyamount.

luckyties (lt)

Sets the “tie this step to the next” setting of the affected steps randomly to tie or normal. This is the same as setting
the gate pattern to the upper most position. The chance for tie is determined by luckyamount.

luckygatepattern (lgp)

Randomizes the gate pattern of the selected steps (there are four different values: once, all, hold and tie). Use
luckyamount to reduce that set.

luckygateprob (lga)

Sets the “randomize gate” values of the affected steps to random values (yes, this is double randomization). The
luckyamount sets the minimum randomization value that will be set (yes, this is inverted). So with luckyamount = 1
you disable randomization and make the gates play always. With luckymount = 0 you set the gate propability to the
lowest possible value (still not 0).
