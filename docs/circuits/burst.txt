# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## burst - Generate burst of pulses

### Inputs
- rate (ra) - Frequency control
  - Type: float
  - Default: 0.0
  - Description: Controls burst rate using V/oct scaling. 0V = 1Hz, 1V = 2Hz, 2V = 4Hz, -1V = 0.5Hz, etc.

- taptempo (tt) - Clock reference
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: none
  - Description: Reference clock input for synchronizing bursts, can be modified by rate

- hz - Direct frequency setting
  - Type: float
  - Default: 1.0
  - Description: Set frequency in Hz directly, works with rate but exclusive to taptempo

- trigger (t) - Burst trigger
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: none
  - Description: Trigger input to start burst sequence

- reset (r) - Reset trigger
  - Type: trigger
  - Default: none
  - Description: Immediately stops any ongoing burst

- count (c) - Burst count
  - Type: integer
  - Default: 1
  - Description: Number of triggers to send in one burst

- skip (s) - Initial delay
  - Type: integer
  - Default: 0
  - Description: Number of time slots to wait before starting the burst

### Outputs
- output (o) - Trigger output
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: Outputs the generated burst triggers

Note: When a new trigger arrives while a burst is ongoing, the current burst is immediately restarted. The circuit ensures no triggers are lost even at very high frequencies.
