Description

quantize (q)

1 2 3

2

Switches on quantization in two levels. At 0, the faders run freely and output a continous CV.
1
At 1, the output is quantized to semitones, which is 12
V steps. Also the faders will get artiﬁcal notches – one for each
semitone. That is, unless your range is too large. The maximum number of notches with force feedback is 25, so if
your range exceeds two octaves (0.2), the notches are turned off.

At 2, the output is quantized to the scale that root and degree deﬁne. Furthermore the individual scale notes can be
switched on or off with the parameters select1, select3 and so on. Note: the root input does not select the lowest
note of the CV range. That is still set with cvbase. It is just used for selecting the scale.

cvnotches (cn)

1 2 3

0

0

no quantization

1

quantize to semitones (1/12V steps)

2

quantize to the scale set by root and degree

Usually the CVs of the steps are ment to be note pitches (when quantize is 1 or 2), or just free CVs (quantize = 0).
There is an alternative mode, however, that allows you to assign integer values like 0, 1, 2 and so on to each step.
To do this set cvnotches to a value of 2 or greater. This deﬁnes the number of discrete values (and hence notches)
for each step and put CVs of the sequence into notched mode. 1 makes no sense, of course, since in this “pitch bend
mode” the faders would always return to the neutral position.
In notched mode the cv output does not output a pitch but a notch number starting from 0. cvbase, cvrange and
quantize are ignored.
The maximum number of notches is 127, but the haptic force feedback of the motor faders is disabled starting at 26.

shiftsteps (sh)

1 2 3

0

Shifts all your steps by that number to the left (negative numbers shift to the right). So if shiftsteps is 1, right after
a reset, the sequencer will not play step 1, but step 2. The shifting wraps around at the end of your sequence, so if you
have 24 steps and shift is 1, the sequencer will play step 1 instead of step 24.
Note: Other things like startstep, endstep, playmode, from and autoreset take place after shifting.

startstep (ss)

1 2 3

1

Sets the ﬁrst step to be used. This means that after a reset or when the sequencer comes to the end of the sequence,
it will begin at this step.
There is also a way for settings start and end with buttons (see below at buttonmode). If you use the interactive mode,
the startstep and endstep settings will be overridden. The are reactived if you clear everything.
Note: startstep and endstep take place after applying shiftsteps.

endstep (es)

1 2 3

Sets the last of the steps to be played. The default is to play all steps. After playing the end step, the sequencer moves
on to the start step at the next clock tick.
If startstep is equal to endstep, the sequence just consists of one single step.
Settings startstep larger then endstep is allowed and reverses the playing order.

form (fo)

1 2 3

0

This is an advanced feature that allows you to slice your steps into two or three parts and create musical song forms
like AAAB or ABAC. Each of the parts A, B or C are then played according to the playmode.
The form AAAB, for example, creates a 32 step form from just 16 steps, by playing the ﬁrst 8 steps three times and
then the second 8 steps once.
The following forms are available:
0

A (forms are basically deactivated)

1

AAAB

2

AABB

3

ABAC

4

AAABAAAC

5

AB

6

AAB

Notes:
• The splitting of the steps into parts takes place after accounting for startstep and endstep.
• Forms with A, B and C split the pattern into three parts. These parts can only be of equal size if the number of
steps is dividable by 3, of course.
• The pattern AB is really not the same as A, e.g when direction is set 1 (reverse). In that case each of the parts
is played backwards, but the parts themselves move forwards on your steps.
direction (d)

0

Sets the general direction in which the sequencer moves through the steps. 0 means forwards and 1 means backwards.

pingpong (pp)

0

If set to 1, the sequencer will change the direction every time it reaches the start or end of the sequence.
