Description
Selects a TRS port to use as input (3.5 mm jack). fromtrs = 0 disables TRS, fromtrs = 10 enables auto detection.
See the manual of midiin for details on port selection.
Selects a USB port to use as input. fromusb = 0 disables USB, fromusb = 10 enables auto detection. See the manual
of midiin for details on port selection.
Selects which TRS MIDI port to output to. See the manual of midiout for details on port selection.
Selects which USB MIDI port to output to. See the manual of midiout for details on port selection.

minifonion – Musical quantizer

This circuit is a very musical quantizer that
gently moves any input CV (pitch information on a 1V/oct base) into selected notes
of a musical scale. Typically the input
CV is coming from a random source, LFO,
melody generator or sequencer.
In fact the Minifonion is very similar to each of the the
three quantizer channels in the Audiophile Circuit League
Sinfonion – just without the user interface and more ﬂexible. It has Sinfonion compatible CVs for the root note and
the scale selection so it can easily be combined with it as
long as you control the Sinfonion via CV and stick to the
ﬁrst mode. But of course you do not need a Sinfonion in
order to use this circuit!
If you want to mimick a Sinfonion with the
you
might also be interested in the circuits arpeggio (see
page 127) and chord (see page 154).
Here is the simplest possible application – a quantization
of some (random) input pitch at I1 to the seven notes of
a C lydian major scale.
[minifonion]
input = I1
output = O2

Now let’s change the root note to D (2 semitones above
C) and the scale to natural minor, so that we now quantize to a D minor scale:
[minifonion]
input = I1
output = O2
root
= 2
degree = 7

And here is the table of the ﬁrst 12 scales of the Minifonion. These are exactly the same scales as those in the
ﬁrst mode (called Chords) of the Sinfonion:

degree

Abbr.

Scale

0

lyd

Lydian major scale (it has a ♯4)

1

maj

Normal major scale (ionian)

2

X7

Mixolydian (dominant seven chords)

3

sus

mixolydian with 3rd /4th swapped

4

alt

Altered scale

5

hm5

Harmonic minor scale from the 5th

6

dor

Dorian minor (minor with ♯13)

7

min

Natural minor (aeolian)

8

hm

Harmonic minor (♭6 but ♯7)

9

phr

Phrygian minor scale (with ♭9)

10

dim

Diminished scale (whole/half tone)

11

aug

Augmented scale (just whole tones)

input = I1
output = O2
root
= I2 * 120 # base on semitones
degree = I3 * 120 # base on semitones

You ﬁnd the complete table of all 108 scales on page 107.
If you are a Sinfonion user, please note that the inputs
root and degree of the Minifonion are not based on semitones like the Sinfonion, but simply expect whole numbers like 0, 1, 2 and so on (which corresponds to the CVs
0V, 10V, 20V, etc.). So if you want those CV inputs to be
compatible, you have to multiply the values with the factor of 120 before sending them to the Minifonion:

Patch the unquantized input voltage here
This jack is optional. If you patch it, the Minifonion will work in triggered mode. Here the output pitch is always frozen
until the next trigger happens.

If you set this gate input to 1 then quantization is bypassed and the input voltage is directly copied to the output.

0

Set the root note here. 0 means C, 1 means C♯, 2 means D and so on. If you multiply the value of an input like I1 with
120, then you can use a 1V/Oct input for selecting the root note via a sequencer, MIDI keyboard or the like. Also then
you are compatible with the ROOT CV input of the Sinfonion.
