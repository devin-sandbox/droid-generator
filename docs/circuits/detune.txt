# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## detune - Detune multiple voices in a disharmonic way

### Inputs
- input1 ... input8 (i) - Voice inputs
  - Type: float
  - Description: Input pitch CVs for up to 8 voices that will be detuned

- detune (d) - Detune amount
  - Type: float
  - Default: 0.0
  - Description: Controls the amount of detuning applied to the voices. Each voice is detuned differently to create disharmonic relationships.

- tuningmode (tm) - Tuning mode
  - Type: binary
  - Default: 0
  - Description: While this is 1, the circuit will output the value set by tuningpitch instead of the actual pitch. This is meant to be a help for tuning your VCOs.

- tuningpitch (tp) - Tuning reference
  - Type: float
  - Default: 0V
  - Description: This pitch CV will be output while the tuning mode is active.

### Outputs
- output1 ... output8 (o) - Detuned outputs
  - Type: float
  - Description: Detuned versions of the input pitches. Each output is detuned differently to create disharmonic relationships.

Note: Detunes up to 8 voices in different ways to create disharmonic relationships. Compatible with Sinfonion's detune algorithm. Can be controlled by LFOs or envelopes for dynamic detuning effects.
