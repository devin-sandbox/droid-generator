# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## switch - Addressable/Clockable Switch

### Inputs
- input1...input16 - Signal inputs
  - Type: float
  - Default: 0.0
  - Description: 1st through 16th inputs, must be used in order without gaps

- forward - Forward trigger
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: Advances switch position by one step forward

- backward - Backward trigger
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: Advances switch position by one step backward

- reset - Position reset
  - Type: trigger
  - Description: Returns switch to initial position (offset 0)
  - Note: Takes precedence over forward/backward within 5ms

- offset - Position control
  - Type: integer
  - Default: 0
  - Description: CV addressable switching offset
  - Note: Value is added to internal offset (multiply external CV)

### Outputs
- output1...output16 - Signal outputs
  - Type: float
  - Description: 1st through 16th outputs, must be used in order without gaps
  - Note: Unconnected outputs send to void, unconnected inputs treated as 0V

Note: Versatile switching circuit with features:
- Up to 16x16 matrix switching
- CV addressable routing
- Trigger-based stepping
- Bidirectional control
- Position reset
- Multiple routing modes

Example applications:
- Signal distribution
- Sequential switching
- Matrix routing
- CV addressing
- Signal selection
- Multi-channel control

Limitations:
- Must use inputs/outputs in order
- No individual muting
- No crossfading
- No mixing capability
- No state memory
- Fixed matrix size
