octave – Multi-VCO octave animator

This circuit is used to control the pitches of
three oscillators by octave or even ﬁfths. It
also allows a linear detune in order to make
the common sound of the VCOs sound fatter.
Here is an example for a setup where the octave spreading and the detune is controlled with two pots:
[octave]
input
output1
output2
output3
spread
detune

= I1
= O1
= O2
= O3
= P1.1
= P1.2

Patch the 1 V / octave inputs of three VCOs at O1, O2 and
O3. Tune all VCOs at exactly the same pitch. Patch the
pitch output from your sequencer, quantizer or whatever
to I1.
Now with the pot P1.1 turned fully left nothing changes.
All VCOs will get exactly the same pitch. As you turn up
the pot the pitches of the VCOs 2 and 3 will start to get octaved up more and more until VCO 2 is two octaves above
VCO 1 and VCO 3 is four octaves above VCO 1.
If you add fifths = on then intermediate steps shift the
pitch by perfect ﬁfths.
Note: The output output1 was implemented just for sake
of completeness. It passes through the input to output1,
since the pitch of VCO 1 is never detuned nor pitched up.
If you are running low in outputs then some use a passive
multiple or stacked cable and connect VCO 1 externally
the pitch and thus save one output.

Detune
In the example, if you turn P1.2, VCO 2 will be detuned
up and VCO 3 down. A very slight turn will get get you
the nice fat classical detune sound. The speciality here
is: the detune is linear. This means that the detune is always done by the same number of Hertz – regardless of
the current pitch. This is done by automatically adapting
the detune voltage to be less in higher pitches and greater
in lower pitches. The result is a beating independent of
pitch.

Animation
Since everything in
is CV’able so is spread. A nice
application is to use a sequencer or clocked random generator for animating the octaving. Here is an example:
[random]
trigger
output

= I1
= _RANDOM

[octave]
input
output1
output2
output3
spread

= I1
= O1
= O2
= O3
= _RANDOM * P1.1

Now P1.1 controls the depth of random octave animation.

Description

0V

The general pitch information on a 1 V / octave base to be used for the three VCOs.

0

The amount of octave spread between output1 and output3. At a value of 1.0 the spread is four octaves.

0.0

The amount of linear detune of VCO 2 and 3. This is not on a 1 V / octave base but corresponds to an absolute frequency
difference in Hertz. The exact frequency difference cannot be set here, since that depends on how you have tuned your
VCOs. But the rule is the following: If input is a 0 V and detune is 1.0, the detune is by four semitones. And for an
input of 1 V (one octave higher) it is just two semitones, because that results in the same frequency difference. For
2 V (two octaves up) it ist just one semitone and for 3 V half a semitone (and so on). Best thing is to simply try out and
listen!

off

Set this to 1 or on if you want to include perfect ﬁfths as intermediate steps.

Description
Outputs for the 1 V / octave of the three VCOs. output1 is an exact copy of input so you could omit that and rather
patch VCO 1 to the original pitch CV.
