explin – Exponential to linear converter

This circuit converts an exponential input
curve into a linear output curve. Image you
have an analog envelope outputting an exponential curve like the following one:

an envelope voltage then startvalue would be the start
or maximum voltage of that envelope.

[explin]
input
= I1
output = O2
startvalue = 8V
endvalue = 0.5V

A falling exponential curve will never reach 0 in theory.
So with endvalue you set a value (or voltage) in that you
consider the curve to be low enough to be inaudible. At
that voltage the linear output will exactly be zero. This
voltage can be used to control the slope of the linear output curve. The following example shows how different
values of endvalue affect the output:

The curve starts at 8 V and reaches 0.5 V at about 500 ms
later.
The following droid patch will convert this into a linear
curve:

With the values startvalue and endvalue you conﬁgure how this translation is scaled. The startvalue selects the voltage where the exponential input curve and
the linear output curve should be the same. If the input is

Default

Description

input (i)

0.0

Patch an exponential envelope output or a similar signal here. This value must be positive or otherwise it will be set to
0.0.

startvalue (sv)

1.0

The assumed maximum value of the input signal (the start voltage from where it decays in an exponential way.

endvalue (ev)

0.01

The value at which it is assumed to be zero (at which the linear output will be set to zero. This value must be positive.
It is forced to be >= 0.001.

1.0

Sets the mix between the “dry” and “wet” signal: At 0.0 the output is the same as the input. At 1.0 the output is the
linear curve. At a value in between it is some average. You are even allowed to used values > 1.0. A value of 2.0 will
overcompensate and bend the curve beyond linearity into a curve some modularists would call logarithmic.

faderbank – Create multiple virtual faders in M4 controller

This circuit is very similar to motorfader
(see page 311) but controls up to 16 faders
at once. It’s purpose is to reduce the number of motorfader circuits in situations
where you control banks or arrays of parameters in a similar way. It does not add any extra functionality to motorfader.
That being said, it is easiest to just show the differences
to a single motorfader circuit. And these are:
• Instead of fader you set firstfader to specify
which faders you want to control. The number of
faders does not need to be set since it corresponds
to the number of output jacks you use.

• Instead of output you have output1, output2 and
so on. This determines the number of faders that
are controlled by this circuit.
• The parameters notches and ledcolor are common for all controlled faders. They are identical as
those in motorfader.
• The parameters ledvalue1, ledvalue2, ... can set
the brightness of the individual LEDs below the
faders.
• Because of memory limitations you only have 6
presets (motorfader has 8).
Here is an example of a fader bank of the three faders 3,
4 and 5 (spreading over two M4s). We use a pot to se-

lect one of six presets (from 0 to 5). Turning the pot will
immediately switch the preset (and the faders will move
accordingly). And the CVs will be sent to outputs O1, O2
and O3:
[p2b8]
[m4]
[faderbank]
preset = P1.1 * 6
output1 = O1
output2 = O2
output3 = O3

Number of artiﬁcal notches. 0 disables the notches. 1 creates a pitch bend wheel. 2 creates a binary switch with the
output values 0 and 1. Higher number create that number of notches. E.g. 8 creates eight notches and output will
output one of the value 0, 1, ... 8.
The maximum number of notches is 201. But if you select more than 25 notches, the force feedback is turned off as
the notches would get too small to work.

startvalue (sv)

0.0

This sets the value the faders should get when the circuit starts for the ﬁrst time or when you send a trigger to clear.

ledcolor (lc)

When you use this input, it will set the color of the LED below the faders, when the circuit is selected. If the LED is off,
this setting has now impact.

ledvalue1 ... ledvalue16

When you use this input, it will override the brightness of the LEDs below the faders, but just when this circuit is
selected.

The select input allows you to overlay buttons and LEDs with multiple functions. If you use this input, the circuit will
process the buttons and LEDs just as if select has a positive gate signal (usually you will select this to 1). Otherwise
it won’t touch them so they can be used by another circuit. Note: even if the circuit is currently not selected, it will
nevertheless work and process all its other inputs and its outputs (those that do not deal with buttons or LEDs) in a
normal way.
