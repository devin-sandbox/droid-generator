# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## superjust - Perfect Intonation for Multiple Voices

### Inputs
- input1...input8 - Pitch inputs
  - Type: voltage (1V/Oct)
  - Description: Input pitches to be retuned for just intonation

- tuningmode - Tuning enable
  - Type: binary
  - Default: 0
  - Description: When 1, outputs tuningpitch for VCO calibration

- tuningpitch - Reference pitch
  - Type: voltage (1V/Oct)
  - Default: 0V
  - Description: Output voltage during tuning mode

- bypass - Bypass control
  - Type: binary
  - Default: 0
  - Description: When 1, passes inputs directly to outputs without retuning

- transpose - Global transpose
  - Type: voltage (1V/Oct)
  - Default: 0V
  - Description: Added to all outputs (except in tuning/bypass modes)

### Outputs
- output1...output8 - Retuned pitches
  - Type: voltage (1V/Oct)
  - Description: Just-intonation adjusted pitch outputs

Note: Advanced tuning circuit with features:
- Dynamic just intonation
- Up to 8 voice polyphony
- Automatic ratio detection
- Built-in tuning mode
- Global transposition
- Bypass functionality

Example applications:
- Pure chord generation
- Ensemble tuning
- Microtonal music
- Perfect intervals
- Harmonic series
- Multi-voice tuning

Limitations:
- Requires precise VCO calibration
- Small pitch adjustments only
- No scale memory
- No historical temperaments
- No manual ratio input
- Maximum 8 voices
