# DROID Circuit Input/Output Keys

## octave - Multi-VCO Octave Animator

### Inputs
- input - Pitch input
  - Type: 1V/Oct
  - Default: 0V
  - Description: Base pitch CV for all VCOs (1V/octave)

- spread - Octave spread
  - Type: float
  - Default: 0
  - Description: Amount of octave spread between outputs (1.0 = 4 octaves)

- detune - Detune amount
  - Type: float
  - Default: 0.0
  - Description: Linear frequency detune between VCOs (1.0 = 4 semitones at 0V)

- fifths - Fifth intervals
  - Type: binary
  - Default: off
  - Description: Enable perfect fifths as intermediate steps

### Outputs
- output1...output3 - VCO outputs
  - Type: 1V/Oct
  - Description: Pitch CV outputs for three VCOs
  - Note: output1 is direct copy of input

Note: VCO pitch animator with features:
- Three VCO pitch control
- Octave spreading
- Linear frequency detuning
- Perfect fifth intervals
- CV-controllable parameters

Example applications:
- Fat oscillator sounds
- Multi-octave patches
- Animated chord voicings
- Detuned unison effects
- Pitch spread animation
- Harmonic voice stacking

Limitations:
- Fixed three outputs
- Linear detune only
- No individual VCO control
- No other intervals besides fifths
- output1 is pass-through only
