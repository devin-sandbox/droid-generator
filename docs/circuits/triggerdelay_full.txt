Input

Type

Default

Description

start (st)

0.0

Start value of the transient

end (e)

1.0

Target value of the transient

duration (d)

1.0

Duration: if the clock input is used, it is in clock ticks. Otherwise it is in seconds. A negative duration will be treated
as zero. And a zero duration will make the output always be at end level.

loop (lo)

0

If this is set to 1, the transient will start over again as soon as it reaches the end.

pingpong (pp)

0

If this set to 1, the transient will start moving backwards towards the start when it has reached end. It will swing back
and forth, in fact looping inﬁnitely.

freeze (f)

0

while this is set to 1, the transient it frozen at its current position.

reset (r)

A trigger here will immediately set the transient back to its start value.

clock (c)

If you patch a clock here, the duration will be set in terms of clock ticks, not of seconds. This needs to be a steady clock
in order to get predictable results.

Output

Type

Description

output (o)

Here comes the current value of the transient.

phase (p)

This output reﬂects the current phase of the transient. It behaves as if start would be 0 and end would be 1.

endoftransient (et)

When loop and pingpong is off, this output goes to 1 when the transient has reached the end – and stays there. In loop
mode just a short trigger is sent. In pingpong mode that trigger is not sent when the transient has reach the end-value,
but when it is back at start (i.e. after one full cycle).

triggerdelay – Trigger Delay with multi tap and optional clocking

This circuit implements a CV controllable
delay for a trigger or gate signal. It listens
for triggers at input and sends the same
triggers later to the output. It does not
look at the voltage level of the inputs. The
output triggers are always sent with 10 V (I1 ... I8) or
5 V (on the G8 expander).
As a difference to an analog trigger delay this circuit is capable of keeping memory of up to 16 triggers. This means
it is able to process further incoming triggers while previous triggers are still in the delay. This allows you to delay
complex rhythmic patterns, e.g. in order to reuse the output of one track of a trigger sequencer shifted in time for
another instrument.
Furthermore, it is able to retain the gate length of the
original input signal and output the delayed gate with exactly the same length.
Here is the simplest possible example, which delays an
incoming gates / triggers by exactly one second:

Input

You can set the delay in seconds via the delay jack. And
if you patch gatelength, the original gate length is being
ignored and overridden by this value (also in seconds):
[triggerdelay]
input
= G1
output
= G2
delay
= 0.1 # 0.1 seconds
gatelength = 0.05 # 50 ms

Clocked mode

[triggerdelay]
input
= G1
output
= G2
clock
= G3

If you specify delay and/or gatelength they are now
measured in clock cycles:
[triggerdelay]
input
= G1
output
= G2
clock
= G3
delay
= 16 # clock cycles
gatelength = 0.5 # half a clock cycle

triggerdelay supports a clocked mode, in which all tim-

ing is relative to an input clock. You enable clocked mode
by simply patching a steady clock into clock. Now delay
and gatelength are relative to one clock cycle.

Default

Description

input (i)

0

Patch triggers or gates to be delayed here.

delay (dl)

1.0

Amount of time the incoming triggers are being delayed. When clock is patched, this is in relation to one clock cycle,
so a delay of 4 will delay the input pattern by exactly 4 beats. Fractions are allowed also. If clock is not patched, this
parameter is in seconds. So for example in order to delay by 100 ms you need a delay of 0.1.

gatelength (gl)

+

repeats (rp)
mute (m)

DROID manual for blue-6

Type

The following example delays all input triggers by one
clock cycle (which is the default):

[triggerdelay]
input
= G1
output
= G2

1 2 3

Unless you patch this jack the length of the output gates is exactly the length of the input gates. By use of this parameter you override that length and set a ﬁxed length in seconds – or if clock is being used – in clock cycles.

1

Number of times the delayed trigger is being repeated. Each further repetition is with the same delay.

0

A high gate signal suppresses any further output gates. However, the current gate is ﬁnished normally.

Input

Type

Description
When you patch this input, the trigger delay runs in clocked mode. In this mode delay is relative to one clock cycle.
I.e. a delay if 0.5 will delay the trigger by half a clock cycle. The same holds for gatelength. That is measured in clock
cycles, too.

clock (c)

Output

Default

Type

Description

output (o)

Outputs the delayed triggers/gates, while keeping the gate length – unless you have changed that

overflow (ov)

Whenever there are more input triggers than this circuit can keep memory of, this output outputs a gate of 0.5 sec
length. You can wire this to an LED in order to know when this happens.
